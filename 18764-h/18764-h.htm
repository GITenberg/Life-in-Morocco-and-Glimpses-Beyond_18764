<h3>FOREWORD</h3>

<p>
Which of us has yet forgotten that first day when
we set foot in Barbary? Those first impressions,
as the gorgeous East with all its countless sounds
and colours, forms and odours, burst upon us;
mingled pleasures and disgusts, all new, undreamed-of,
or our wildest dreams enhanced! Those yelling,
struggling crowds of boatmen, porters, donkey-boys;
guides, thieves, and busy-bodies; clad in
mingled finery and tatters; European, native, nondescript;
a weird, incongruous medley&mdash;such as is
always produced when East meets West&mdash;how they
did astonish and amuse us! How we laughed
(some trembling inwardly) and then, what letters
we wrote home!</p>
<p>
One-and-twenty years have passed since that experience
entranced the present writer, and although
he has repeated it as far as possible in practically
every other oriental country, each fresh visit to
Morocco brings back somewhat of the glamour of
that maiden plunge, and somewhat of that youthful
ardour, as the old associations are renewed.
Nothing he has seen elsewhere excels Morocco
in point of life and colour save Bokhára; and<a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;vi]</span>
only in certain parts of India or in China is it
rivalled. Algeria, Tunisia and Tripoli have lost
much of that charm under Turkish or western
rule; Egypt still more markedly so, while Palestine
is of a population altogether mixed and heterogeneous.
The bazaars of Damascus, even, and
Constantinople, have given way to plate-glass, and
nothing remains in the nearer East to rival Morocco.</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding the disturbed condition of much
of the country, nothing has occurred to interfere
with the pleasure certain to be afforded by a visit
to Morocco at any time, and all who can do so
are strongly recommended to include it in an early
holiday. The best months are from September to
May, though the heat on the coast is never too
great for an enjoyable trip. The simplest way of
accomplishing this is by one of Messrs. Forwood's
regular steamers from London, calling at most of
the Morocco ports and returning by the Canaries,
the tour occupying about a month, though it may
be broken and resumed at any point. Tangier
may be reached direct from Liverpool by the
Papayanni Line, or indirectly <i>viâ</i> Gibraltar, subsequent
movements being decided by weather and
local sailings. British consular officials, missionaries,
and merchants will be found at the various
ports, who always welcome considerate strangers.</p>
<p>
Comparatively few, even of the ever-increasing
number of visitors who year after year bring this
only remaining independent Barbary State within<a name="pagevii" id="pagevii"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;vii]</span>
the scope of their pilgrimage, are aware of the
interest with which it teems for the scientist, the
explorer, the historian, and students of human
nature in general. One needs to dive beneath
the surface, to live on the spot in touch with the
people, to fathom the real Morocco, and in this it
is doubtful whether any foreigners not connected by
ties of creed or marriage ever completely succeed.
What can be done short of this the writer attempted
to do, mingling with the people as one of themselves
whenever this was possible. Inspired by the
example of Lane in his description of the "Modern
Egyptians," he essayed to do as much for the
Moors, and during eighteen years he laboured to
that end.</p>
<p>
The present volume gathers together from many
quarters sketches drawn under those circumstances,
supplemented by a <i>resumé</i> of recent events and the
political outlook, together with three chapters&mdash;viii.,
xi., and xiv.&mdash;contributed by his wife, whose
assistance throughout its preparation he has once
more to acknowledge with pleasure. To many
correspondents in Morocco he is also indebted for
much valuable up-to-date information on current
affairs, but as most for various reasons prefer to
remain unmentioned, it would be invidious to name
any. For most of the illustrations, too, he desires
to express his hearty thanks to the gentlemen who
have permitted him to reproduce their photographs.</p>
<p>
Much of the material used has already appeared<a name="pageviii" id="pageviii"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;viii]</span>
in more fugitive form in the <i>Times of Morocco</i>, the
<i>London Quarterly Review</i>, the <i>Forum</i>, the <i>Westminster
Review</i>, <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, the <i>Humanitarian</i>,
the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, the <i>Independent</i>
(New York), the <i>Modern Church</i>, the <i>Jewish
Chronicle</i>, <i>Good Health</i>, the <i>Medical Missionary</i>,
the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, the <i>Westminster Gazette</i>,
the <i>Outlook</i>, etc., while Chapters ix., xix., and xxv.
to xxix. have been extracted from a still unpublished
picture of Moorish country life, "Sons of
Ishmael."</p>

"The firmament turns, and times are changing."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
By the western gate of the Mediterranean, where
the narrowed sea has so often tempted invaders,
the decrepit Moorish Empire has become itself a
bait for those who once feared it. Yet so far
Morocco remains untouched, save where a fringe
of Europeans on the coast purvey the luxuries from
other lands that Moorish tastes demand, and in
exchange take produce that would otherwise be
hardly worth the raising. Even here the foreign
influence is purely superficial, failing to affect the
lives of the people; while the towns in which
Europeans reside are so few in number that
whatever influence they do possess is limited in
area. Moreover, Morocco has never known foreign
dominion, not even that of the Turks, who have
left their impress on the neighbouring Algeria and
Tunisia. None but the Arabs have succeeded in
obtaining a foothold among its Berbers, and they,
restricted to the plains, have long become part of
<a name="page2" id="page2"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;2]</span>
the nation. Thus Morocco, of all the North African
kingdoms, has always maintained its independence,
and in spite of changes all round, continues to live
its own picturesque life.</p>
<p>
Picturesque it certainly is, with its flowing
costumes and primitive homes, both of which vary
in style from district to district, but all of which
seem as though they must have been unchanged
for thousands of years. Without security for life
or property, the mountaineers go armed, they dwell
in fortresses or walled-in villages, and are at constant
war with one another. On the plains, except in the
vicinity of towns, the country people group their
huts around the fortress of their governor, within
which they can shelter themselves and their possessions
in time of war. No other permanent
erection is to be seen on the plains, unless it be
some wayside shrine which has outlived the ruin
fallen on the settlement to which it once belonged,
and is respected by the conquerors as holy ground.
Here and there gaunt ruins rise, vast crumbling
walls of concrete which have once been fortresses,
lending an air of desolation to the scene, but offering
no attraction to historian or antiquary. No
one even knows their names, and they contain no
monuments. If ever more solid remains are encountered,
they are invariably set down as the work
of the Romans.</p>

<p>
Yet Morocco has a history, an interesting history
indeed, one linked with ours in many curious ways,
as is recorded in scores of little-known volumes.
It has a literature amazingly voluminous, but there
were days when the relations with other lands were
much closer, if less cordial, the days of the crusades
and the Barbary pirates, the days of European<a name="page3" id="page3"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;3]</span>
tribute to the Moors, and the days of Christian
slavery in Morocco. Constantly appearing brochures
in many tongues made Europe of those days
acquainted with the horrors of that dreadful land.
All these only served to augment the fear in which
its people were held, and to deter the victimized
nations from taking action which would speedily
have put an end to it all, by demonstrating the inherent
weakness of the Moorish Empire.</p>
<p>
But for those whose study is only the Moors as
they exist to-day, the story of Morocco stretches
back only a thousand years, as until then its scattered
tribes of Berber mountaineers had acknowledged no
head, and knew no common interests; they were not
a nation. War was their pastime; it is so now to
a great extent. Every man for himself, every tribe
for itself. Idolatry, of which abundant traces still
remain, had in places been tinged with the name
and some of the forms of Christianity, but to what
extent it is now impossible to discover. In the
Roman Church there still exist titular bishops of
North Africa, one, in particular, derives his title
from the district of Morocco of which Fez is now
the capital, Mauretania Tingitana.</p>
<p>
It was among these tribes that a pioneer mission
of Islám penetrated in the eighth of our centuries.
Arabs were then greater strangers in Barbary than
we are now, but they were by no means the first
strange faces seen there. Ph&oelig;nicians, Romans
and Vandals had preceded them, but none had
stayed, none had succeeded in amalgamating with
the Berbers, among whom those individuals who did
remain were absorbed.  These hardy clansmen,<a name="page4" id="page4"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;4]</span>
exhibiting the characteristics of hill-folk the world
round, still inhabited the uplands and retained
their independence. In this they have indeed succeeded
to a great extent until the present day, but
between that time and this they have given of their
life-blood to build up by their side a less pure nation
of the plains, whose language as well as its creed is
that of Arabia.</p>
<p>
To imagine that Morocco was invaded by a
Muslim host who carried all before them is a great
mistake, although a common one. Mulai Idrees&mdash;"My
Lord Enoch" in English&mdash;a direct descendant
of Mohammed, was among the first of the
Arabian missionaries to arrive, with one or two
faithful adherents, exiles fleeing from the Khalîfa
of Mekka. So soon as he had induced one tribe
to accept his doctrines, he assisted them with his
advice and prestige in their combats with hereditary
enemies, to whom, however, the novel terms were
offered of fraternal union with the victors, if they
would accept the creed of which they had become
the champions. Thus a new element was introduced
into the Berber polity, the element of combination,
for the lack of which they had always
been weak before. Each additional ally meant an
augmentation of the strength of the new party
out of all proportion to the losses from occasional
defeats.</p>
<p>
In course of time the Mohammedan coalition
became so strong that it was in a position to dictate
terms and to impose governors upon the most
obstinate of its neighbours. The effect of this was
to divide the allies into two important sections, the
older of which founded Fez in the days of the son<a name="page5" id="page5"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;5]</span>
of Idrees, accounted the second ameer of that
name, who there lies buried in the most important
mosque of the Empire, the very approaches of
which are closed to the Jew and the Nazarene.
The only spot which excels it in sanctity is that
at Zarhôn, a day's journey off, in which the first
Idrees lies buried. There the whole town is forbidden
to the foreigner, and an attempt made by
the writer to gain admittance in disguise was frustrated
by discovery at the very gate, though later
on he visited the shrine in Fez. The dynasty thus
formed, the Shurfà Idreeseeïn, is represented to-day
by the Shareef of Wazzán.</p>
<p>
In southern Morocco, with its capital at Aghmát,
on the Atlas slopes, was formed what later
grew to be the kingdom of Marrákesh, the city
of that name being founded in the middle of
the eleventh century. Towards the close of the
thirteenth, the kingdoms of Fez and Marrákesh
became united under one ruler, whose successor,
after numerous dynastic changes, is the Sultan of
Morocco now.<a name="I1r" id="I1r"></a><a href="#I1"><sup>*</sup></a></p>
<p>
But from the time that the united Berbers
had become a nation, to prevent them falling out
among themselves again it was necessary to find
some one else to fight, to occupy the martial instinct
nursed in fighting one another. So long as there
were ancient scores to be wiped out at home, so
long as under cover of a missionary zeal they could
continue intertribal feuds, things went well for the
victors; but as soon as excuses for this grew scarce,
it was needful to fare afield. The pretty story&mdash;told,<a name="page6" id="page6"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;6]</span>
by the way, of other warriors as well&mdash;of the Arab
leader charging the Atlantic surf, and weeping that
the world should end there, and his conquests too,
may be but fiction, but it illustrates a fact. Had
Europe lain further off, the very causes which had
conspired to raise a central power in Morocco would
have sufficed to split it up again. This, however,
was not to be. In full view of the most northern
strip of Morocco, from Ceuta to Cape Spartel, the
north-west corner of Africa, stretches the coast of
sunny Spain. Between El K'sar es-Sagheer,
"The Little Castle," and Tarifa Point is only a
distance of nine or ten miles, and in that southern
atmosphere the glinting houses may be seen across
the straits.</p>
<p>
History has it that internal dissensions at the
Court of Spain led to the Moors being actually
invited over; but that inducement was hardly
needed. Here was a country of infidels yet to be
conquered; here was indeed a land of promise.
Soon the Berbers swarmed across, and in spite of
reverses, carried all before them. Spain was then
almost as much divided into petty states as their
land had been till the Arabs taught them better,
and little by little they made their way in a country
destined to be theirs for five hundred years. Córdova,
Sevílle, Granáda, each in turn became their
capital, and rivalled Fez across the sea.</p>
<p>
The successes they achieved attracted from the
East adventurers and merchants, while by wise administration
literature and science were encouraged,
till the Berber Empire of Spain and Morocco took a
foremost rank among the nations of the day. Judged
from the standpoint of their time, they seem to us a<a name="page7" id="page7"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;7]</span>
prodigy; judged from our standpoint, they were but
little in advance of their descendants of the twentieth
century, who, after all, have by no means retrograded,
as they are supposed to have done, though
they certainly came to a standstill, and have suffered
all the evils of four centuries of torpor and stagnation.
Civilization wrought on them the effects that
it too often produces, and with refinement came
weakness. The sole remaining state of those which
the invaders, finding independent, conquered one by
one, is the little Pyrenean Republic of Andorra, still
enjoying privileges granted to it for its brave defence
against the Moors, which made it the high-water
mark of their dominion. As peace once more split
up the Berbers, the subjected Spaniards became
strong by union, till at length the death-knell of
Moorish rule in Europe sounded at the nuptials of
the famous Ferdinand and Isabella, linking Aragon
with proud Castile.</p>
<p>
Expelled from Spain, the Moor long cherished
plans for the recovery of what had been lost, preparing
fleets and armies for the purpose, but in vain.
Though nominally still united, his people lacked that
zeal in a common cause which had carried them
across the straits before, and by degrees the
attempts to recover a kingdom dwindled into continued
attacks upon shipping and coast towns.
Thus arose that piracy which was for several
centuries the scourge of Christendom. Further east
a distinct race of pirates flourished, including Turks
and Greeks and ruffians from every shore, but they
were not Moors, of whom the Salli rover was the
type. Many thousands of Europeans were carried
off by Moorish corsairs into slavery, including not<a name="page8" id="page8"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;8]</span>
a few from England. Those who renounced their
own religion and nationality, accepting those of their
captors, became all but free, only being prevented
from leaving the country, and often rose to important
positions. Those who had the courage of
their convictions suffered much, being treated like
cattle, or worse, but they could be ransomed when
their price was forthcoming&mdash;a privilege abandoned
by the renegades&mdash;so that the principal object of
every European embassy in those days was the
redemption of captives. Now and then escapes
would be accomplished, but such strict watch was
kept when foreign merchantmen were in port, or
when foreign ambassadors came and went, that few
attempts succeeded, though many were made.</p>
<p>
Sympathies are stirred by pictures of the martyrdom
of Englishmen and Irishmen, Franciscan
missionaries to the Moors; and side by side with
them the foreign mercenaries in the native service,
Englishmen among them, who would fight in any
cause for pay and plunder, even though their
masters held their countrymen in thrall. And thrall
it was, as that of Israel in Egypt, when our sailors
were chained to galley seats beneath the lash of a
Moor, or when they toiled beneath a broiling sun
erecting the grim palace walls of concrete which still
stand as witnesses of those fell days. Bought and
sold in the market like cattle, Europeans were more
despised than Negroes, who at least acknowledged
Mohammed as their prophet, and accepted their lot
without attempt to escape.</p>
<p>
Dark days were those for the honour of Europe,
when the Moors inspired terror from the Balearics
to the Scilly Isles, and when their rovers swept the<a name="page9" id="page9"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;9]</span>
seas with such effect that all the powers of Christendom
were fain to pay them tribute. Large sums of
money, too, collected at church doors and by the
sale of indulgences, were conveyed by the hands of
intrepid friars, noble men who risked all to relieve
those slaves who had maintained their faith, having
scorned to accept a measure of freedom as the
reward of apostasy. Thousands of English and
other European slaves were liberated through the
assistance of friendly letters from Royal hands, as
when the proud Queen Bess addressed Ahmad II.,
surnamed "the Golden," as "Our Brother after the
Law of Crown and Sceptre," or when Queen Anne
exchanged compliments with the bloodthirsty Ismáïl,
who ventured to ask for the hand of a daughter of
Louis XIV.</p>
<p>
In the midst of it all, when that wonderful man,
with a household exceeding Solomon's, and several
hundred children, had reigned forty-three of his
fifty-five years, the English, in 1684, ceded to him
their possession of Tangier. For twenty-two years
the "Castle in the streights' mouth," as General
Monk had described it, had been the scene of as
disastrous an attempt at colonization as we have
ever known: misunderstanding of the circumstances
and mismanagement throughout; oppression, peculation
and terror within as well as without; a constant
warfare with incompetent or corrupt officials
within as with besieging Moors without; till at
last the place had to be abandoned in disgust,
and the expensive mole and fortifications were
destroyed lest others might seize what we could
not hold.</p>
<p>
Such events could only lower the prestige of
<a name="page10" id="page10"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;10]</span>
Europeans, if, indeed, they possessed any, in the
eyes of the Moors, and the slaves up country received
worse treatment than before. Even the
ambassadors and consuls of friendly powers were
treated with indignities beyond belief. Some were
imprisoned on the flimsiest pretexts, all had to
appear before the monarch in the most abject
manner, and many were constrained to bribe the
favourite wives of the ameers to secure their
requests. It is still the custom for the state reception
to take place in an open courtyard, the
ambassador standing bareheaded before the mounted
Sultan under his Imperial parasol. As late as
1790 the brutal Sultan El Yazeed, who emulated
Ismáïl the Bloodthirsty, did not hesitate to declare
war on all Christendom except England, agreeing
to terms of peace on the basis of tribute. Cooperation
between the Powers was not then thought
of, and one by one they struck their bargains as
they are doing again to-day.</p>
<p>
Yet even at the most violent period of Moorish
misrule it is a remarkable fact that Europeans were
allowed to settle and trade in the Empire, in all
probability as little molested there as they would
have been had they remained at home, by varying
religious tests and changing governments. It is
almost impossible to conceive, without a perusal
of the literature of the period, the incongruity of
the position. Foreign slaves would be employed
in gangs outside the dwellings of free fellow-countrymen
with whom they were forbidden to
communicate, while every returning pirate captain
added to the number of the captives, sometimes
bringing friends and relatives of those who lived in<a name="page11" id="page11"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;11]</span>
freedom as the Sultan's "guests," though he considered
himself "at war" with their Governments.
So little did the Moors understand the position of
things abroad, that at one time they made war upon
Gibraltar, while expressing the warmest friendship
for England, who then possessed it. This was done
by Mulai Abd Allah V., in 1756, because, he said,
the Governor had helped his rebel uncle at Arzîla,
so that the English, his so-called friends, did more
harm than his enemies&mdash;the Portuguese and
Spaniards. "My father and I believe," wrote his
son, Sidi Mohammed, to Admiral Pawkers, "that
the king your master has no knowledge of the
behaviour towards us of the Governor of Gibraltar,
 ... so Gibraltar shall be excluded from the peace
to which I am willing to consent between England
and us, and with the aid of the Almighty God, I
will know how to avenge myself as I may on the
English of Gibraltar."</p>
<p>
Previously Spain and Portugal had held the
principal Moroccan seaports, the twin towns of
Rabat and Salli alone remaining always Moorish,
but these two in their turn set up a sort of independent
republic, nourished from the Berber tribes
in the mountains to the south of them. No Europeans
live in Salli yet, for here the old fanaticism
slumbers still. So long as a port remained in
foreign hands it was completely cut off from the
surrounding country, and played no part in Moorish
history, save as a base for periodical incursions.
One by one most of them fell again into the hands
of their rightful owners, till they had recovered all
their Atlantic sea-board. On the Mediterranean,
Ceuta, which had belonged to Portugal, came under<a name="page12" id="page12"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;12]</span>
the rule of Spain when those countries were united,
and the Spaniards hold it still, as they do less
important positions further east.</p>
<p>
The piracy days of the Moors have long passed,
but they only ceased at the last moment they could
do so with grace, before the introduction of steamships.
There was not, at the best of times, much
of the noble or heroic in their raids, which generally
took the nature of lying in wait with well-armed,
many-oared vessels, for unarmed, unwieldy merchantmen
which were becalmed, or were outpaced
by sail and oar together.</p>
<p>
Early in the nineteenth century Algiers was
forced to abandon piracy before Lord Exmouth's
guns, and soon after the Moors were given to
understand that it could no longer be permitted
to them either, since the Moorish "fleets"&mdash;if
worthy the name&mdash;had grown so weak, and those
of the Nazarenes so strong, that the tables were
turned. Yet for many years more the nations of
Europe continued the tribute wherewith the rapacity
of the Moors was appeased, and to the United
States belongs the honour of first refusing this
disgraceful payment.</p>
<p>
The manner in which the rovers of Salli and
other ports were permitted to flourish so long can
be explained in no other way than by the supposition
that they were regarded as a sort of necessary
nuisance, just a hornet's-nest by the wayside, which
it would be hopeless to destroy, as they would
merely swarm elsewhere. And then we must
remember that the Moors were not the only
pirates of those days, and that Europeans have
to answer for the most terrible deeds of the<a name="page13" id="page13"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;13]</span>
Mediterranean corsairs. News did not travel then
as it does now. Though students of Morocco
history are amazed at the frequent captures and the
thousands of Christian slaves so imported, abroad it
was only here and there that one was heard of
at a time.</p>
<p>
To-day the plunder of an Italian sailing vessel
aground on their shore, or the fate of too-confident
Spanish smugglers running close in with arms, is
heard of the world round. And in the majority
of cases there is at least a question: What were
the victims doing there? Not that this in any
way excuses the so-called "piracy," but it must not
be forgotten in considering the question. Almost
all these tribes in the troublous districts carry
European arms, instead of the more picturesque
native flint-lock: and as not a single gun is legally
permitted to pass the customs, there must be a
considerable inlet somewhere, for prices are not
high.</p>

<h2>THE PRESENT DAY</h2>

<p class="center1">
"What has passed has gone, and what is to come is distant;
Thou hast only the hour in which thou art."</p>
<p class="rindent">
                           <i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>


<p>
Far from being, as Hood described them, "poor
rejected Moors who raised our childish fears," the
people of Morocco consist of fine, open races, capable
of anything, but literally rotting in one of the finest
countries of the world. The Moorish remains in
Spain, as well as the pages of history, testify to the
manner in which they once flourished, but to-day
their appearance is that of a nation asleep. Yet
great strides towards reform have been made during
the past century, and each decade sees steps taken
more important than the last. For the present
decade is promised complete transformation.</p>
<p>
But how little do we know of this people! The
very name "Moor" is a European invention, unknown
in Morocco, where no more precise definition
of the inhabitants can be given than that of
"Westerners"&mdash;Maghribîn, while the land itself is
known as "The Further West"&mdash;El Moghreb el
Aksa. The name we give to the country is but
a corruption of that of the southern capital,
Marrákesh ("Morocco City") through the Spanish
version, Marueccos.</p>

<a name="page15" id="page15"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;15]</span>
<p>
The genuine Moroccans are the Berbers among
whom the Arabs introduced Islám and its civilization,
later bringing Negroes from their raids
across the Atlas to the Sudán and Guinea. The
remaining important section of the people are Jews
of two classes&mdash;those settled in the country from
prehistoric times, and those driven to it when
expelled from Spain. With the exception of the
Arabs and the Blacks, none of these pull together,
and in that case it is only because the latter are
either subservient to the former, or incorporated
with them.</p>
<p>
First in importance come the earliest known
possessors of the land, the Berbers. These are not
confined to Morocco, but still hold the rocky fastnesses
which stretch from the Atlantic, opposite the
Canaries, to the borders of Egypt; from the sands
of the Mediterranean to those of the Sáhara, that
vast extent of territory to which we have given
their name, Barbary. Of these but a small proportion
really amalgamated with their Muslim
victors, and it is only to this mixed race which
occupies the cities of Morocco that the name
"Moor" is strictly applicable.</p>
<p>
On the plains are to be found the Arabs, their
tents scattered in every direction. From the
Atlantic to the Atlas, from Tangier to Mogador,
and then away through the fertile province of Sûs,
one of the chief features of Morocco is the series of
wide alluvial treeless plains, often apparently as flat
as a table, but here and there cut up by winding
rivers and crossed by low ridges. The fertility of
these districts is remarkable; but owing to the misgovernment
of the country, which renders native<a name="page16" id="page16"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;16]</span>
property so insecure, only a small portion is cultivated.
The untilled slopes which border the plains
are generally selected by the Arabs for their encampments,
circles or ovals of low goat-hair tents,
each covering a large area in proportion to the
number of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>
The third section of the people of Morocco&mdash;by
no means the least important&mdash;has still to be glanced
at; these are the ubiquitous, persecuted and persecuting
Jews. Everywhere that money changes
hands and there is business to be done they are to
be found. In the towns and among the thatched
huts of the plains, even in the Berber villages on
the slopes of the Atlas, they have their colonies.
With the exception of a few ports wherein European
rule in past centuries has destroyed the boundaries,
they are obliged to live in their own restricted
quarters, and in most instances are only permitted
to cross the town barefooted and on foot, never to
ride a horse. In the Atlas they live in separate
villages adjoining or close to those belonging to
the Berbers, and sometimes even larger than they.
Always clad in black or dark-coloured cloaks, with
hideous black skull-caps or white-spotted blue kerchiefs
on their heads, they are conspicuous everywhere.
They address the Moors with a villainous,
cringing look which makes the sons of Ishmael
savage, for they know it is only feigned. In return
they are treated like dogs, and cordial hatred exists
on both sides. So they live, together yet divided;
the Jew despised but indispensable, bullied but
thriving. He only wins at law when richer than
his opponent; against a Muslim he can bear no
testimony; there is scant pretence at justice. He<a name="page17" id="page17"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;17]</span>
dares not lift his hand to strike a Moor, however ill-treated,
but he finds revenge in sucking his life's
blood by usury. Receiving no mercy, he shows
none, and once in his clutches, his prey is fortunate
to escape with his life.</p>
<p>
The happy influence of more enlightened
European Jews is, however, making itself felt in
the chief towns, through excellent schools supported
from London and Paris, which are turning out a
class of highly respectable citizens. While the
Moors fear the tide of advancing westernization,
the town Jews court it, and in them centres one of
the chief prospects of the country's welfare. Into
their hands has already been gathered much of the
trade of Morocco, and there can be little doubt that,
by the end of the thirty years' grace afforded to
other merchants than the French, they will have
practically absorbed it all, even the Frenchmen
trading through them. They have at least the
intimate knowledge of the people and local conditions
to which so few foreigners ever attain.</p>
<p>
When the Moorish Empire comes to be pacifically
penetrated and systematically explored, it
will probably be found that little more is known
of it than of China, notwithstanding its proximity,
and its comparatively insignificant size. A map
honestly drawn, from observations only, would
astonish most people by its vast blank spaces.<a name="II1r" id="II1r"></a><a href="#II1"><sup>*</sup></a> It
would be noted that the limit of European exploration&mdash;with
the exception of the work of two or
three hardy travellers in disguise&mdash;is less than two
hundred miles from the coast, and that this limit<a name="page18" id="page18"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;18]</span>
is reached at two points only&mdash;south of Fez and
Marrákesh respectively,&mdash;which form the apices of
two well-known triangular districts, the contiguous
bases of which form part of the Atlantic coast line,
under four hundred miles in length. Beyond these
limits all is practically unknown, the language, customs
and beliefs of the people providing abundant
ground for speculation, and permitting theorists free
play. So much is this the case, that a few years ago
an enthusiastic "savant" was able to imagine that he
had discovered a hidden race of dwarfs beyond the
Atlas, and to obtain credence for his "find" among
the best-informed students of Europe.</p>
<p>
But there is also another point of view from
which Morocco is unknown, that of native thought
and feeling, penetrated by extremely few Europeans,
even when they mingle freely with the people, and
converse with them in Arabic. The real Moor is
little known by foreigners, a very small number
of whom mix with the better classes. Some, as
officials, meet officials, but get little below the official
exterior. Those who know most seldom speak,
their positions or their occupations preventing the
expression of their opinions. Sweeping statements
about Morocco may therefore be received with
reserve, and dogmatic assertions with caution.
This Empire is in no worse condition now than it
has been for centuries; indeed, it is much better
off than ever since its palmy days, and there is no
occasion whatever to fear its collapse.</p>
<p>
Few facts are more striking in the study of
Morocco than the absolute stagnation of its people,
except in so far as they have been to a very limited
extent affected by outside influences. Of what<a name="page19" id="page19"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;19]</span>
European&mdash;or even oriental&mdash;land could descriptions
of life and manners written in the sixteenth
century apply as fully in the twentieth as do those
of Morocco by Leo Africanus? Or even to come
later, compare the transitions England has undergone
since Höst and Jackson wrote a hundred years
ago, with the changes discoverable in Morocco since
that time. The people of Morocco remain the same,
and their more primitive customs are those of far
earlier ages, of the time when their ancestors lived
upon the plain of Palestine and North Arabia, and
when "in the loins of Abraham" the now unfriendly
Jew and Arab were yet one. It is the position of
Europeans among them which has changed.</p>
<p>
In the time of Höst and Jackson piracy was
dying hard, restrained by tribute from all the
Powers of Europe. The foreign merchant was
not only tolerated, but was at times supplied with
capital by the Moorish sultans, to whom he was
allowed to go deeply in debt for custom's dues, and
half a century later the British Consul at Mogador
was not permitted to embark to escape a bombardment
of the town, because of his debt to the Sultan.
Many of the restrictions complained of to-day are
the outcome of the almost enslaved condition of the
merchants of those times in consequence of such
customs. Indeed, the position of the European in
Morocco is still a series of anomalies, and so it is
likely to continue until it passes under foreign rule.</p>
<p>
The same old spirit of independence reigns in
the Berber breast to-day as when he conquered
Spain, and though he has forgotten his past and
cares naught for his future, he still considers himself
a superior being, and feels that no country can rival<a name="page20" id="page20"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;20]</span>
his home. In his eyes the embassies from Europe
and America come only to pay the tribute which
is the price of peace with his lord, and when he
sees a foreign minister in all his black and gold
stand in the sun bareheaded to address the mounted
Sultan beneath his parasol, he feels more proud
than ever of his greatness, and is more decided
to be pleasant to the stranger, but to keep him out.</p>
<p>
Instead of increased relations between Moors
and foreigners tending to friendship, the average
foreign settler or tourist is far too bigoted and
narrow-minded to see any good in the native, much
less to acknowledge his superiority on certain points.
Wherever the Sultan's authority is recognized the
European is free to travel and live, though past
experience has led officials not to welcome him.
At the same time, he remains entirely under the
jurisdiction of his own authorities, except in cases
of murder or grave crime, when he must be at once
handed over to the nearest consul of his country.
Not only are he and his household thus protected,
but also his native employees, and, to a certain
extent, his commercial and agricultural agents.</p>
<p>
Thus foreigners in Morocco enjoy within the
limits of the central power the security of their own
lands, and the justice of their own laws. They do
not even find in Morocco that immunity from justice
which some ignorant writers of fiction have supposed;
for unless a foreigner abandons his own nationality
and creed, and buries himself in the interior under
a native name, he cannot escape the writs of foreign
courts. In any case, the Moorish authorities will
arrest him on demand, and hand him over to his
consul to be dealt with according to law. The<a name="page21" id="page21"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;21]</span>
colony of refugees which has been pictured by
imaginative raconteurs is therefore non-existent.
Instead there are growing colonies of business men,
officials, missionaries, and a few retired residents,
quite above the average of such colonies in the
Levant, for instance.</p>
<p>
For many years past, though the actual business
done has shown a fairly steady increase, the commercial
outlook in Morocco has gone from bad to
worse. Yet more of its products are now exported,
and there are more European articles in demand,
than were thought of twenty years ago. This
anomalous and almost paradoxical condition is due
to the increase of competition and the increasing
weakness of the Government. Men who had hope
a few years ago, now struggle on because they have
staked too much to be able to leave for more
promising fields. This has been especially the
case since the late Sultan's death. The disturbances
which followed that event impoverished many
tribes, and left behind a sense of uncertainty and
dread. No European Bourse is more readily or
lastingly affected by local political troubles than the
general trade of a land like Morocco, in which men
live so much from hand to mouth.</p>
<p>
It is a noteworthy feature of Moorish diplomatic
history that to the Moors' love of foreign trade we
owe almost every step that has led to our present
relations with the Empire. Even while their rovers
were the terror of our merchantmen, as has been
pointed out, foreign traders were permitted to reside
in their ports, the facilities granted to them forming
the basis of all subsequent negotiations. Now that
concession after concession has been wrung from<a name="page22" id="page22"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;22]</span>
their unwilling Government, and in spite of freedom
of residence, travel, and trade in the most important
parts of the Empire, it is disheartening to see the
foreign merchant in a worse condition than ever.</p>
<p>
The previous generation, fewer in number, enjoying
far less privileges, and subjected to restrictions
and indignities that would not be suffered to-day,
were able to make their fortunes and retire, while
their successors find it hard to hold their own.
The "hundred tonners" who, in the palmy days of
Mogador, were wont to boast that they shipped no
smaller quantities at once, are a dream of the past.
The ostrich feathers and elephants' tusks no longer
find their way out by that port, and little gold now
passes in or out. Merchant princes will never
be seen here again; commercial travellers from
Germany are found in the interior, and quality, as
well as price, has been reduced to its lowest ebb.</p>
<p>
A crowd of petty trading agents has arisen with
no capital to speak of, yet claiming and abusing
credit, of which a most ruinous system prevails, and
that in a land in which the collection of debts is
proverbially difficult, and oftentimes impossible.
The native Jews, who were interpreters and
brokers years ago, have now learned the business
and entered the lists. These new competitors
content themselves with infinitesimal profits, or
none at all in cases where the desideratum is cash
to lend out at so many hundreds per cent. per
annum. Indeed, it is no uncommon practice for
goods bought on long credit to be sold below cost
price for this purpose. Against such methods who
can compete?</p>
<p>
Yet this is a rich, undeveloped land&mdash;not exactly<a name="page23" id="page23"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;23]</span>
an El Dorado, though certainly as full of promise
as any so styled has proved to be when reached&mdash;favoured
physically and geographically, but politically
stagnant, cursed with an effete administration,
fettered by a decrepit creed. In view of this
situation, it is no wonder that from time to time
specious schemes appear and disappear with clockwork
regularity. Now it is in England, now in
France, that a gambling public is found to hazard
the cost of proving the impossibility of opening the
country with a rush, and the worthlessness of so-called
concessions and monopolies granted by sheïkhs
in the south, who, however they may chafe under
existing rule which forbids them ports of their own,
possess none of the powers required to treat with
foreigners.</p>
<p>
As normal trade has waned in Morocco, busy
minds have not been slow in devising illicit, or at
least unusual, methods of making money, even, one
regrets to say, of making false money. Among
the drawbacks suffered by the commerce which
pines under the shade of the shareefian umbrella,
one&mdash;and that far from the least&mdash;is the unsatisfactory
coinage, which till a few years ago was almost
entirely foreign. To have to depend in so important
a matter on any mint abroad is bad enough,
but for that mint to be Spanish means much.
Centuries ago the Moors coined more, but with the
exception of a horrible token of infinitesimal value
called "floos," the products of their extinct mints
are only to be found in the hands of collectors, in
buried hoards, or among the jewellery displayed at
home by Mooresses and Jewesses, whose fortunes,
so invested, may not be seized for debt. Some<a name="page24" id="page24"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;24]</span>
of the older issues are thin and square, with well-preserved
inscriptions, and of these a fine collection&mdash;mostly
gold&mdash;may be seen at the British Museum;
but the majority, closely resembling those of India
and Persia, are rudely stamped and unmilled, not
even round, but thick, and of fairly good metal.
The "floos" referred to (<i>sing.</i> "fils") are of three
sizes, coarsely struck in zinc rendered hard and
yellow by the addition of a little copper. The
smallest, now rarely met with, runs about 19,500
to £1 when this is worth 32&frac12; Spanish pesetas; the
other two, still the only small change of the country,
are respectively double and quadruple its value.
The next coin in general circulation is worth 2<i>d.</i>,
so the inconvenience is great. A few years ago,
however, Europeans resident in Tangier resolutely
introduced among themselves the Spanish ten and
five céntimo pieces, corresponding to our 1<i>d.</i> and
&frac12;<i>d.</i>, which are now in free local use, but are not
accepted up-country.</p>
<p>
What passes as Moorish money to-day has been
coined in France for many years, more recently
also in Germany; the former is especially neat, but
the latter lacks style. The denominations coincide
with those of Spain, whose fluctuations in value they
closely follow at a respectful distance. This autumn
the "Hasáni" coin&mdash;that of Mulai el Hasan, the late
Sultan&mdash;has fallen to fifty per cent. discount on
Spanish. With the usual perversity also, the common
standard "peseta," in which small bargains are struck
on the coast, was omitted, the nearest coin, the
quarter-dollar, being nominally worth ptas. 1.25. It
was only after a decade, too, that the Government
put in circulation the dollars struck in France,<a name="page25" id="page25"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;25]</span>
which had hitherto been laid up in the treasury
as a reserve. And side by side with the German
issue came abundant counterfeit coins, against which
Government warnings were published, to the serious
disadvantage of the legal issue. Even the Spanish
copper has its rival, and a Frenchman was once
detected trying to bring in a nominal four hundred
dollars' worth of an imitation, which he promptly
threw overboard when the port guards raised
objections to its quality.</p>
<p>
The increasing need of silver currency inland,
owing to its free use in the manufacture of trinkets,
necessitates a constant importation, and till
recently all sorts of coins, discarded elsewhere,
were in circulation. This was the case especially
with French, Swiss, Belgian, Italian, Greek, Roumanian,
and other pieces of the value of twenty
céntimos, known here by the Turkish name "gursh,"
which were accepted freely in Central Morocco, but
not in the north. Twenty years ago Spanish
Carolus, Isabella and Philippine shillings and
kindred coins were in use all over the country,
and when they were withdrawn from circulation in
Spain they were freely shipped here, till the
country was flooded with them. When the merchants
and customs at last refused them, their
astute importers took them back at a discount,
putting them into circulation later at what they
could, only to repeat the transaction. In Morocco
everything a man can be induced to take is legal
tender, and for bribes and religious offerings all
things pass, this practice being an easier matter
than at first sight appears; so in the course of a
few years one saw a whole series of coins in vogue,<a name="page26" id="page26"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;26]</span>
one after the other, the main transactions taking
place on the coast with country Moors, than whom,
though none more suspicious, none are more easily
gulled.</p>
<p>
A much more serious obstacle to inland trade is
the periodically disturbed state of the country, not
so much the local struggles and uprisings which
serve to free superfluous energy, as the regular
administrative expeditions of the Moorish Court,
or of considerable bodies of troops. These used to
take place in some direction every year, "the time
when kings go forth to war" being early summer,
just when agricultural operations are in full swing,
and every man is needed on his fields. In one
district the ranks of the workers are depleted by a
form of conscription or "harka," and in another
these unfortunates are employed preventing others
doing what they should be doing at home. Thus
all suffer, and those who are not themselves engaged
in the campaign are forced to contribute cash, if only
to find substitutes to take their places in the
ranks.</p>
<p>
The movement of the Moorish Court means the
transportation of a numerous host at tremendous
expense, which has eventually to be recouped in the
shape of regular contributions, arrears of taxes and
fines, collected <i>en route</i>, so the pace is abnormally
slow. Not only is there an absolute absence of
roads, and, with one or two exceptions, of bridges,
but the Sultan himself, with all his army, cannot
take the direct route between his most important
inland cities without fighting his way. The configuration
of the empire explains its previous sub-division
into the kingdoms of Fez, Marrákesh,<a name="page27" id="page27"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;27]</span>
Tafilált and Sûs, and the Reef, for between the
plains of each run mountain ranges which have
never known absolute "foreign" rulers.</p>

<b>CROSSING A MOROCCO RIVER.</b>
</p><br /><br />

<p>
To European engineers the passes through these
closed districts would offer no great obstacles in the
construction of roads such as thread the Himalayas,
but the Moors do not wish for the roads; for, while
what the Government fears to promote thereby is
combination, the actual occupants of the mountains,
the native Berbers, desire not to see the Arab tax-gatherers,
only tolerating their presence as long as
they cannot help it, and then rising against them.</p>
<p>
Often a tribe will be left for several years to enjoy
independence, while the slip-shod army of the Sultan
is engaged elsewhere. When its turn comes it holds
out for terms, since it has no hope of successfully
confronting such an overwhelming force as is sooner
or later brought against it. The usual custom is to
send small detachments of soldiers to the support of
the over-grasping functionaries, and when they have
been worsted, to send down an army to "eat up"
the province, burning villages, deporting cattle, ill-treating
the women, and often carrying home
children as slaves. The men of the district probably
flee and leave their homes to be ransacked.
They content themselves with hiding behind crags
which seem to the plainsmen inaccessible, whence
they can in safety harass the troops on the march.
After more or less protracted skirmishing, the
country having been devastated by the troops, who
care only for the booty, women will be sent into the
camp to make terms, or one of the shareefs or
religious nobles who accompany the army is sent
out to treat with the rebels. The terms are usually<a name="page28" id="page28"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;28]</span>
hard&mdash;so much arrears of tribute in cash and kind,
so much as a fine for expenses, so many hostages.
Then hostages and prisoners are driven to the
capital in chains, and pickled heads are exposed on
the gateways, imperial letters being read in the chief
mosques throughout the country, telling of a glorious
victory, and calling for rejoicings. To any other
people the short spell of freedom would have been
too dearly bought for the experiment to be repeated,
but as soon as they begin to chafe again beneath
the lawless rule of Moorish officials, the Berbers
rebel once more. It has been going on thus for
hundreds of years, and will continue till put an end
to by France.</p>
<p>
In Morocco each official preys upon the one
below him, and on all others within his reach, till
the poor oppressed and helpless villager lives in
terror of them all, not daring to display signs of
prosperity for fear of tempting plunder. Merit is
no key to positions of trust and authority, and few
have such sufficient salary attached to render them
attractive to honest men. The holders are expected
in most cases to make a living out of the pickings,
and are allowed an unquestioned run of office till
they are presumed to have amassed enough to make
it worth while treating them as they have treated
others, when they are called to account and relentlessly
"squeezed." The only means of staving off
the fatal day is by frequent presents to those above
them, wrung from those below. A large proportion
of Moorish officials end their days in disgrace, if
not in dungeons, and some meet their end by being
invited to corrosive sublimate tea, a favourite
beverage in Morocco&mdash;for others.  Yet there is<a name="page29" id="page29"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;29]</span>
always a demand for office, and large prices are
paid for posts affording opportunities for plunder.</p>
<p>
The Moorish financial system is of a piece with
this method. When the budget is made out, each
tribe or district is assessed at the utmost it is
believed capable of yielding, and the candidate for
its governorship who undertakes to get most out of
it probably has the task allotted to him. His first
duty is to repeat on a small scale the operation
of the Government, informing himself minutely as
to the resources under his jurisdiction, and assessing
the sub-divisions so as to bring in enough for himself,
and to provide against contingencies, in addition
to the sum for which he is responsible. The local
sheïkhs or head-men similarly apportion their
demands among the individuals entrusted to their
tender mercy. A fool is said to have once presented
the Sultan with a bowl of skimmed and watered
milk, and on being remonstrated with, to have
declared that His Majesty received no more from
any one, as his wazeers and governors ate half the
revenue cream each, and the sheïkhs drank half the
revenue milk. The fool was right.</p>
<p>
The richer a man is, the less proportion he will
have to pay, for he can make it so agreeable&mdash;or
disagreeable&mdash;for those entrusted with a little brief
authority. It is the struggling poor who have to
pay or go to prison, even if to pay they have to
sell their means of subsistence. Three courses lie
before this final victim&mdash;to obtain the protection of
some influential name, native or foreign, to buy a
"friend at court," or to enter Nazarene service.
But native friends are uncertain and hard to find,
and, above all, they may be alienated by a higher<a name="page30" id="page30"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;30]</span>
bid from a rival or from a rapacious official. Such
affairs are of common occurrence, and harrowing
tales might be told of homes broken up in this way,
of tortures inflicted, and of lives spent in dungeons
because display has been indulged in, or because an
independent position has been assumed under cover
of a protection that has failed. But what can one
expect with such a standard of honour?</p>
<p>
Foreigners, on the other hand, seldom betray
their <i>protégés</i>&mdash;although, to their shame be it
mentioned, some in high places have done so,&mdash;wherefore
their protection is in greater demand;
besides which it is more effectual, as coming from
outside, while no Moor, however well placed, is
absolutely secure in his own position. Thus it is
that the down-trodden natives desire and are
willing to pay for protection in proportion to their
means; and it is this power of dispensing protection
which, though often abused, does more than
anything else to raise the prestige of the foreigner,
and in turn to protect him.</p>
<p>
The claims most frequently made against Moors
by foreign countries are for debt, claims which
afford the greatest scope for controversy and the
widest loophole for abuse. Although, unfortunately,
for the greater part usurious, a fair proportion are
for goods delivered, but to evade the laws even loan
receipts are made out as for goods to be delivered,
a form in which discrimination is extremely difficult.
The condition of the country, in which every man
is liable to be arrested, thrashed, imprisoned, if not
tortured, to extort from him his wealth, is such as
furnishes the usurer with crowding clients; and the
condition of things among the Indian cultivators,<a name="page31" id="page31"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;31]</span>
bad as it is, since they can at least turn to a fair-handed
Government, is not to be compared to that
of the down-trodden Moorish farmer.</p>
<p>
The assumption by the Government of responsibility
for the debts of its subjects, or at all events
its undertaking to see that they pay, is part of the
patriarchal system in force, by which the family is
made responsible for individuals, the tribe for
families, and so on. No other system would bring
offenders to justice without police; but it transforms
each man into his brother's keeper. This,
however, does not apply only to debts the collection
of which is urged upon the Government, for whom
it is sufficient to produce the debtor and let him
prove absolute poverty for him to be released,
with the claim cancelled. This in theory: but
in practice, to appease these claims, however
just, innocent men are often thrown into prison,
and untold horrors are suffered, in spite of all
the efforts of foreign ministers to counteract the
injustice.</p>
<p>
A mere recital of tales which have come under
my own observation would but harrow my readers'
feelings to no purpose, and many would appear
incredible. With the harpies of the Government
at their heels, men borrow wildly for a month or
two at cent. per cent., and as the Moorish law
prohibits interest, a document is sworn to before
notaries by which the borrower declares that he has
that day taken in hard cash the full amount to be
repaid, the value of certain crops or produce of
which he undertakes delivery upon a certain date.
Very seldom, indeed, does it happen that by that
date the money can be repaid, and generally the<a name="page32" id="page32"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;32]</span>
only terms offered for an extension of time for
another three or six months are the addition of
another fifty or one hundred per cent. to the debt,
always fully secured on property, or by the bonds of
property holders. Were not this thing of everyday
occurrence in Morocco, and had I not examined
scores of such papers, the way in which the ignorant
Moors fall into such traps would seem incredible.
It is usual to blame the Jews for it all, and though
the business lies mostly in their hands, it must
not be overlooked that many foreigners engage in
it, and, though indirectly, some Moors also.</p>
<p>
But besides such claims, there is a large proportion
of just business debts which need to be
enforced. It does not matter how fair a claim
may be, or how legitimate, it is very rarely that
trouble is not experienced in pressing it. The
Moorish Courts are so venal, so degraded, that it
is more often the unscrupulous usurer who wins his
case and applies the screw, than the honest trader.
Here lies the rub. Another class of claims is for
damage done, loss suffered, or compensation for
imaginary wrongs. All these together mount up,
and a newly appointed minister or consul-general
is aghast at the list which awaits him. He probably
contents himself at first with asking for the appointment
of a commission to examine and report on the
legality of all these claims, and for the immediate
settlement of those approved. But he asks and is
promised in vain, till at last he obtains the moral
support of war-ships, in view of which the Moorish
Government most likely pays much more than it
would have got off with at first, and then proceeds
to victimize the debtors.</p>

<a name="page33" id="page33"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;33]</span>
<p>
It is with expressed threats of bombardment
that the ships come, but experience has taught
the Moorish Government that it is well not to let
things go that length, and they now invariably
settle amicably. To our western notions it may
seem strange that whatever questions have to be
attended to should not be put out of hand without
requiring such a demonstration; but while there is
sleep there is hope for an Oriental, and the rulers
of Morocco would hardly be Moors if they resisted
the temptation to procrastinate, for who knows what
may happen while they delay? And then there is
always the chance of driving a bargain, so dear to
the Moorish heart, for the wazeer knows full well
that although the Nazarene may be prepared to
bombard, as he has done from time to time, he is
no more desirous than the Sultan that such an
extreme measure should be necessary.</p>
<p>
So, even when things come to the pinch, and the
exasperated representative of Christendom talks
hotly of withdrawing, hauling down his flag and
giving hostile orders, there is time at least to make
an offer, or to promise everything in words. And
when all is over, claims paid, ships gone, compliments
and presents passed, nothing really serious
has happened, just the everyday scene on the
market applied to the nation, while the Moorish
Government has once more given proof of worldly
wisdom, and endorsed the proverb that discretion
is the better part of valour.</p>
<p>
An illustration of the high-handed way in which
things are done in Morocco has but recently been
afforded by the action of France regarding an
alleged Algerian subject arrested by the Moorish<a name="page34" id="page34"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;34]</span>
authorities for conspiracy. The man, Boo Zîan
Miliáni by name, was the son of one of those
Algerians who, when their country was conquered
by the French, preferred exile to submission, and
migrated to Morocco, where they became naturalized.
He was charged with supporting the so-called "pretender"
in the Reef province, where he was arrested
with two others early in August last. His particular
offence appears to have been the reading
of the "Rogi's" proclamations to the public, and
inciting them to rebel against the Sultan. But
when brought a prisoner to Tangier, and thence
despatched to Fez, he claimed French citizenship,
and the Minister of France, then at Court, demanded
his release.</p>
<p>
This being refused, a peremptory note followed,
with a threat to break off diplomatic negotiations if
the demand were not forthwith complied with. The
usual <i>communiqués</i> were made to the Press, whereby
a chorus was produced setting forth the insult to
France, the imminence of war, and the general gravity
of the situation. Many alarming head-lines were
provided for the evening papers, and extra copies
were doubtless sold. In Morocco, however, not
only the English and Spanish papers, but also the
French one, admitted that the action of France was
wrong, though the ultimate issue was never in doubt,
and the man's release was a foregone conclusion.
Elsewhere the rights of the matter would have been
sifted, and submitted at least to the law-courts, if
not to arbitration.</p>
<p>
While the infliction of this indignity was stirring
up northern Morocco, the south was greatly
exercised by the presence on the coast of a French<a name="page35" id="page35"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;35]</span>
vessel, <i>L'Aigle</i>, officers from which proceeded ostentatiously
to survey the fortifications of Mogador
and its island, and then effected a landing on the
latter by night. Naturally the coastguards fired at
them, fortunately without causing damage, but had
any been killed, Europe would have rung with the
"outrage." From Mogador the vessel proceeded
after a stay of a month to Agadir, the first port of
Sûs, closed to Europeans.</p>
<p>
Here its landing-party was met on the beach by
some hundreds of armed men, whose commander
resolutely forbade them to land, so they had to
retire. Had they not done so, who would answer
for the consequences? As it was, the natives,
eager to attack the "invaders," were with difficulty
kept in hand, and one false step would undoubtedly
have led to serious bloodshed. Of course
this was a dreadful rebuff for "pacific penetration,"
but the matter was kept quiet as a little premature,
since in Europe the coast is not quite clear enough
yet for retributory measures. The effect, however,
on the Moors, among whom the affair grew more
grave each time it was recited, was out of all proportion
to the real importance of the incident, which
otherwise might have passed unnoticed.</p>

<h2>BEHIND THE SCENES</h2>

<p class="center1">
"He knows of every vice an ounce."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>


<p>
Though most eastern lands may be described as
slip-shod, with reference both to the feet of their
inhabitants and to the way in which things are done,
there can be no country in the world more aptly
described by that epithet than Morocco. One of
the first things which strikes the visitor to this
country is the universality of the slipper as foot-gear,
at least, so far as the Moors are concerned.
In the majority of cases the men wear the heels
of their slippers folded down under the feet, only
putting them up when necessity compels them to
run, which they take care shall not be too often,
as they much prefer a sort of ambling gait, best
compared to that of their mules, or to that of an
English tramp.</p>
<p>
Nothing delights them better as a means of
agreeably spending an hour or two, than squatting
on their heels in the streets or on some door-stoop,
gazing at the passers-by, exchanging compliments
with their acquaintances. Native "swells"
consequently promenade with a piece of felt under
their arms on which to sit when they wish, in<a name="page37" id="page37"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;37]</span>
addition to its doing duty as a carpet for prayer.
The most public places, and usually the cool of
the afternoon, are preferred for this pastime.</p>
<p>
The ladies of their Jewish neighbours also like
to sit at their doors in groups at the same hour, or
in the doorways of main thoroughfares on moonlight
evenings, while the gentlemen, who prefer
to do their gossiping afoot, roam up and down.
But this is somewhat apart from the point of the
lazy tendencies of the Moors. With them&mdash;since
they have no trains to catch, and disdain punctuality&mdash;all
hurry is undignified, and one could as easily
imagine an elegantly dressed Moorish scribe literally
flying as running, even on the most urgent errand.
"Why run," they ask, "when you might just as
well walk? Why walk, when standing would do?
Why stand, when sitting is so much less fatiguing?
Why sit, when lying down gives so much more rest?
And why, lying down, keep your eyes open?"</p>
<p>
In truth, this is a country in which things are
left pretty much to look after themselves. Nothing
is done that can be left undone, and everything is
postponed until "to-morrow." Slipper-slapper go
the people, and slipper-slapper goes their policy.
If you can get through a duty by only half doing
it, by all means do so, is the generally accepted rule
of life. In anything you have done for you by a
Moor, you are almost sure to discover that he has
"scamped" some part; perhaps the most important.
This, of course, means doing a good deal yourself,
if you like things done well, a maxim holding good
everywhere, indeed, but especially here.</p>
<p>
The Moorish Government's way of doing things&mdash;or
rather, of not doing them if it can find an<a name="page38" id="page38"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;38]</span>
excuse&mdash;is eminently slip-shod. The only point in
which they show themselves astute is in seeing that
their Rubicon has a safe bridge by which they may
retreat, if that suits their plans after crossing it. To
deceive the enemy they hide this as best they can,
for the most part successfully, causing the greatest
consternation in the opposite camp, which, at the
moment when it thinks it has driven them into a
corner, sees their ranks gradually thinning from
behind, dribbling away by an outlet hitherto invisible.
Thus, in accepting a Moor's promise,
one must always consider the conditions or rider
annexed.</p>
<p>
This can be well illustrated by the reluctant
permission to transport grain from one Moorish
port to another, granted from time to time, but so
hampered by restrictions as to be only available to
a few, the Moorish Government itself deriving the
greatest advantage from it. Then, too, there is the
property clause in the Convention of Madrid, which
has been described as the sop by means of which
the Powers were induced to accept other less
favourable stipulations. Instead of being the step
in advance which it appeared to be, it was, in
reality, a backward step, the conditions attached
making matters worse than before.</p>
<p>
In this way only do the Moors shine as politicians,
unless prevarication and procrastination be
included, Machiavellian arts in which they easily
excel. Otherwise they are content to jog along
in the same slip-shod manner as their fathers did
centuries ago, as soon as prosperity had removed
the incentive to exert the energy they once
possessed. The same carelessness marks their<a name="page39" id="page39"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;39]</span>
conduct in everything, and the same unsatisfactory
results inevitably follow.</p>
<p>
But to get at the root of the matter it is necessary
to go a step further. The absolute lack of
morals among the people is the real cause of the
trouble. Morocco is so deeply sunk in the degradation
of vice, and so given up to lust, that it is
impossible to lay bare its deplorable condition. In
most countries, with a fair proportion of the pure
and virtuous, some attempt is made to gloss over
and conceal one's failings; but in this country the
only vice which public opinion seriously condemns
is drunkenness, and it is only before foreigners that
any sense of shame or desire for secrecy about
others is observable. The Moors have not yet
attained to that state of hypocritical sanctimoniousness
in which modern society in civilized lands
delights to parade itself.</p>
<p>
The taste for strong drink, though still indulged
comparatively in secret, is steadily increasing, the
practice spreading from force of example among the
Moors themselves, as a result of the strenuous
efforts of foreigners to inculcate this vice. European
consular reports not infrequently note with
congratulation the growing imports of wines and
liqueurs into Morocco, nominally for the sole use
of foreigners, although manifestly far in excess of
their requirements. As yet, it is chiefly among the
higher and lower classes that the victims are found,
the former indulging in the privacy of their own
homes, and the latter at the low drinking-dens
kept by the scum of foreign settlers in the open
ports. Among the country people of the plains
and lower hills there are hardly any who would touch<a name="page40" id="page40"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;40]</span>
intoxicating liquor, though among the mountaineers
the use of alcohol has ever been more common.</p>
<p>
Tobacco smoking is very general on the coast,
owing to contact with Europeans, but still comparatively
rare in the interior, although the native preparations
of hemp (keef), and also to some extent
opium, have a large army of devotees, more or less
victims. The latter, however, being an expensive
import, is less known in the interior. Snuff-taking
is fairly general among men and women, chiefly the
elderly. What they take is very strong, being a
composition of tobacco, walnut shells, and charcoal
ash. The writer once saw a young Englishman,
who thought he could stand a good pinch of snuff,
fairly "knocked over" by a quarter as much as the
owner of the nut from which it came took with the
utmost complacency.</p>
<p>
The feeling of the Moorish Government about
smoking has long been so strong that in every
treaty with Europe is inserted a clause reserving
the right of prohibiting the importation of all narcotics,
or articles used in their manufacture or consumption.
Till a few years ago the right to deal in
these was granted yearly as a monopoly; but in
1887 the late Sultan, Mulai el Hasan, and his
aoláma, or councillors, decided to abolish the business
altogether, so, purchasing the existing stocks
at a valuation, they had the whole burned. But
first the foreign officials and then private foreigners
demanded the right to import whatever they needed
"for their own consumption," and the abuse of this
courtesy has enabled several tobacco factories to
spring up in the country. The position with regard
to the liquor traffic is almost the same. If the<a name="page41" id="page41"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;41]</span>
Moors were free to legislate as they wished, they
would at once prohibit the importation of intoxicants.</p>
<p>
Of late years, however, a great change has
come over the Moors of the ports, more especially
so in Tangier, where the number of taverns and
<i>cafés</i> has increased most rapidly. During many
years' residence there the cases of drunkenness met
with could be counted on the fingers, and were then
confined to guides or servants of foreigners; on the
last visit paid to the country more were observed
in a month than then in years. In those days to
be seen with a cigarette was almost a crime, and
those who indulged in a whiff at home took care to
deodorize their mouths with powdered coffee; now
Moors sit with Europeans, smoking and drinking,
unabashed, at tables in the streets, but not those
of the better sort. Thus Morocco is becoming
civilized!</p>
<p>
However ashamed a Moor may be of drunkenness,
no one thinks of making a pretence of being
chaste or moral. On the contrary, no worse is
thought of a man who is wholly given up to the
pleasures of the flesh than of one who is addicted
to the most innocent amusements. If a Moor is
remonstrated with, he declares he is not half so
bad as the "Nazarenes" he has come across, who,
in addition to practising most of his vices, indulge
in drunkenness. It is not surprising, therefore,
that the diseases which come as a penalty for these
vices are fearfully prevalent in Morocco. Everywhere
one comes across the ravages of such plagues,
and is sickened at the sight of their victims. Without
going further into details, it will suffice to<a name="page42" id="page42"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;42]</span>
mention that one out of every five patients (mostly
males) who attend at the dispensary of the North
Africa Mission at Tangier are direct, or indirect,
sufferers from these complaints.</p>
<p>
The Moors believe in "sowing wild oats" when
young, till their energy is extinguished, leaving
them incapable of accomplishing anything. Then
they think the pardon of God worth invoking, if
only in the vain hope of having their youth renewed
as the eagle's. Yet if this could happen, they
would be quite ready to commence a fresh series
of follies more outrageous than before. This is a
sad picture, but nevertheless true, and, far from
being exaggerated, does not even hint at much that
exists in Morocco to-day.</p>
<p>
The words of the Korán about such matters
are never considered, though nominally the sole
guide for life. The fact that God is "the Pitying,
the Pitiful, King of the Day of Judgement," is considered
sufficient warrant for the devotees of Islám
to lightly indulge in breaches of laws which they
hold to be His, confident that if they only perform
enough "vain repetitions," fast at the appointed times,
and give alms, visiting Mekka, if possible, or if not,
making pilgrimages to shrines of lesser note nearer
home, God, in His infinite mercy, will overlook all.</p>
<p>
An anonymous writer has aptly remarked&mdash;"Every
good Mohammedan has a perpetual free
pass over that line, which not only secures to him
personally a safe transportation to Paradise, but
provides for him upon his arrival there so luxuriously
that he can leave all the cumbersome baggage of
his earthly harem behind him, and begin his celestial
house-keeping with an entirely new outfit."</p>

<a name="page43" id="page43"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;43]</span>
<p>
Here lies the whole secret of Morocco's backward
state. Her people, having outstepped even
the ample limits of licentiousness laid down in the
Korán, and having long ceased to be even true
Mohammedans, by the time they arrive at manhood
have no energy left to promote her welfare, and
sink into an indolent, procrastinating race, capable of
little in the way of progress till a radical change
takes place in their morals.</p>
<p>
Nothing betrays their moral condition more
clearly than their unrestrained conversation, a
reeking vapour arising from a mass of corruption.
The foul ejaculations of an angry Moor are unreproducible,
only serving to show extreme familiarity
with vice of every sort. The tales to which they
delight to listen, the monotonous chants rehearsed
by hired musicians at public feasts or private entertainments,
and the voluptuous dances they delight
to have performed before them as they lie sipping
forbidden liquors, are all of one class, recounting
and suggesting evil deeds to hearers or observers.</p>
<p>
The constant use made of the name of God,
mostly in stock phrases uttered without a thought
as to their real meaning, is counterbalanced in some
measure by cursing of a most elaborate kind, and
the frequent mention of the "Father of Lies," called
by them "The Liar" <i>par excellence</i>. The term
"elaborate" is the only one wherewith to describe
a curse so carefully worded that, if executed, it would
leave no hope of Paradise either for the unfortunate
addressee or his ancestors for several generations.
On the slightest provocation, or without that excuse,
the Moor can roll forth the most intricate genealogical
objurgations, or rap out an oath. In ordinary<a name="page44" id="page44"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;44]</span>
cases of displeasure he is satisfied with showering
expletives on the parents and grand-parents of the
object of his wrath, with derogatory allusions to the
morals of those worthies' "better halves." "May
God have mercy on thy relatives, O my Lord," is
a common way of addressing a stranger respectfully,
and the contrary expression is used to produce a
reverse effect.</p>
<p>
I am often asked, "What would a Moor think
of this?" Probably some great invention will be
referred to, or some manifest improvement in our
eyes over Moorish methods or manufactures. If
it was something he could see, unless above the
average, he would look at it as a cow looks at a new
gate, without intelligence, realizing only the change,
not the cause or effect. By this time the Moors
are becoming familiar, at least by exaggerated
descriptions, with most of the foreigner's freaks,
and are beginning to refuse to believe that the
Devil assists us, as they used to, taking it for
granted that we should be more ingenious, and
they more wise! The few who think are apt to
pity the rush of our lives, and write us down, from
what they have themselves observed in Europe as
in Morocco, as grossly immoral beside even their
acknowledged failings. The faults of our civilization
they quickly detect, the advantages are mostly
beyond their comprehension.</p>
<p>
Some years ago a friend of mine showed two
Moors some of the sights of London. When they
saw St. Paul's they told of the glories of the
Karûeeïn mosque at Fez; with the towers of
Westminster before them they sang the praises
of the Kûtûbîya at Marrákesh. Whatever they<a name="page45" id="page45"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;45]</span>
saw had its match in Morocco. But at last, as a
huge dray-horse passed along the highway with its
heavy load, one grasped the other's arm convulsively,
exclaiming, "M'bark Allah! Aoûd hadhá!"&mdash;"Blessed
be God! That's a horse!" Here at
least was something that did appeal to the heart
of the Arab. For once he saw a creature he could
understand, the like of which was never bred in
Barbary, and his wonder knew no bounds.</p>
<p>
An equally good story is told of an Englishman
who endeavoured to convince a Moor at home of
the size of these horses. With his stick he drew on
the ground one of their full-sized shoes. "But we
have horses beyond the mountains with shoes <i>this</i>
size," was the ready reply, as the native drew
another twice as big. Annoyed at not being able
to convince him, the Englishman sent home for a
specimen shoe. When he showed it to the Moor,
the only remark he elicited was that a native smith
could make one twice the size. Exasperated now,
and not to be outdone, the Englishman sent home
for a cart-horse skull. "Now you've beaten
me!" at last acknowledged the Moor. "You
Christians can make anything, but <i>we can't make
bones!</i>"</p>
<p>
Bigoted and fanatical as the Moors may show
themselves at times, they are generally willing
enough to be friends with those who show themselves
friendly. And notwithstanding the way in
which the strong oppress the weak, as a nation
they are by no means treacherous or cruel; on the
contrary, the average Moor is genial and hospitable,
does not forget a kindness, and is a man whom one
can respect. Yet it is strange how soon a little<a name="page46" id="page46"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;46]</span>
power, and the need for satisfying the demands of
his superiors, will corrupt the mildest of them;
and the worst are to be found among families
which have inherited office. The best officials
are those chosen from among retired merchants
whose palms no longer itch, and who, by intercourse
with Europeans, have had their ideas of life
broadened.</p>
<p>
The greatest obstacle to progress in Morocco is
the blind prejudice of ignorance. It is hard for the
Moors to realize that their presumed hereditary foes
can wish them well, and it is suspicion, rather than
hostility, which induces them to crawl within their
shell and ask to be left alone. Too often subsequent
events have shown what good ground they
have had for suspicion. It is a pleasure for me to
be able to state that during all the years that I have
lived among them, often in the closest intercourse,
I have never received the least insult, but have
been well repaid in my own coin. What more
could be wished?</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<h2>THE BERBER RACE</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Every lion in his own forest roars."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Few who glibly use the word "Barbarian" pause
to consider whether the present meaning attached
to the name is justified or not, or whether the
people of Barbary are indeed the uncivilized, uncouth,
incapable lot their name would seem to imply
to-day. In fact, the popular ignorance regarding
the nearest point of Africa is even greater than of
the actually less known central portions, where the
white man penetrates with every risk. To declare
that the inhabitants of the four Barbary States&mdash;Morocco,
Algeria, Tunisia, and Tripoli&mdash;are not
"Blackamoors" at all, but white like ourselves, is
to astonish most folk at the outset.</p>
<p>
Of course in lands where the enslavement of
neighbouring negro races has been an institution for
a thousand years or more, there is a goodly proportion
of mulattoes; and among those whose lives have
been spent for generations in field work there are
many whose skins are bronzed and darkened, but
they are white by nature, nevertheless, and town
life soon restores the original hue. The student
class of Fez, drawn from all sections of the population
of Morocco, actually makes a boast of the pale<a name="page48" id="page48"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;48]</span>
and pasty complexions attained by life amid the
shaded cloisters and covered streets of the intellectual
capital. Then again those who are sunburned
and bronzed are more of the Arab stock
than of the Berber.</p>
<p>
These Berbers, the original Barbarians, known
to the Romans and Greeks as such before the Arab
was heard of outside Arabia, are at once the
greatest and the most interesting nation, or rather
race, of the whole of Africa. Had such a coalition
as "the United States of North Africa" been
possible, Europe would long ago have learned to
fear and respect the title "Barbarian" too much to
put it to its present use. But the weak point of the
Berber race has been its lack of homogeneity; it
has ever been split up into independent states and
tribes, constantly indulging in internecine warfare.
This is a principle which has its origin in the relations
of the units whereof they are composed, of
whom it may be said as of the sons of Ishmael, that
every man's hand is against his neighbour. The
vendetta, a result of the <i>lex talionis</i> of "eye for eye
and tooth for tooth," flourishes still. No youth is
supposed to have attained full manhood until he has
slain his man, and excuses are seldom lacking. The
greatest insult that can be offered to an enemy is to
tell him that his father died in bed&mdash;even greater
than the imputation of evil character to his maternal
relatives.</p>
<p>
Some years ago I had in my service a lad of
about thirteen, one of several Reefians whom I had
about me for the practice of their language. Two
or three years later, on returning to Morocco, I met
him one day on the market.</p>

<a name="page49" id="page49"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;49]</span>
<p>
"I am so glad to see you," he said; "I want you
to help me buy some guns."</p>
<p>
"What for?"</p>
<p>
"Well, my father's dead; may God have mercy
on him!"</p>
<p>
"How did he die?"</p>
<p>
"God knows."</p>
<p>
"But what has that to do with the gun?"</p>
<p>
"You see, we must kill my three uncles, I and
my two brothers, and we want three guns."</p>
<p>
"What! Did they kill your father?"</p>
<p>
"God knows."</p>
<p>
"May He deliver you from such a deed. Come
round to the house for some food."</p>
<p>
"But I've got married since you saw me, and
expect an heir, yet they chaff me and call me a boy
because I have never yet killed a man."</p>
<p>
I asked an old servant who had been to England,
and seemed "almost a Christian," to try and dissuade
him, but only to meet with an appreciative,
"Well done! I always thought there was something
in that lad."</p>
<p>
So I tried a second, but with worse results, for
he patted the boy on the back with an assurance
that he could not dissuade him from so sacred a
duty; and at last I had to do what I could myself.
I extorted a promise that he would try and arrange
to take blood-money, but as he left the door his eye
fell on a broken walking-stick.</p>
<p>
"Oh, do give me that! It's no use to you, and
it <i>would</i> make such a nice prop for my gun, as I am
a very bad shot, and we mean to wait outside for
them in the dark."</p>
<p>
The sequel I have never heard.</p>

<a name="page50" id="page50"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;50]</span>
<p>
Up in those mountains every one lives in
fortified dwellings&mdash;big men in citadels, others in
wall-girt villages, all from time to time at war
with one another, or with the dwellers in some
neighbouring valley. Fighting is their element; as
soon as "the powder speaks" there are plenty to
answer, for every one carries his gun, and it is
wonderful how soon upon these barren hills an
armed crowd can muster. Their life is a hard fight
with Nature; all they ask is to be left alone to
fight it out among themselves. Even on the plains
among the Arabs and the mixed tribes described as
Moors, things are not much better, for there, too,
vendettas and cattle lifting keep them at loggerheads,
and there is nothing the clansmen like so
well as a raid on the Governor's kasbah or castle.
These kasbahs are great walled strongholds dotted
about the country; in times of peace surrounded
by groups of huts and tents, whose inhabitants take
refuge inside when their neighbours appear. The
high walls and towers are built of mud concrete,
often red like the Alhambra, the surface of which
stands the weather ill, but which, when kept in
repair, lasts for centuries.</p>
<p>
The Reefian Berbers are among the finest men
in Morocco&mdash;warlike and fierce, it is true, from long
habit and training; but they have many excellent
qualities, in addition to stalwart frames. "If you
don't want to be robbed," say they, "don't come
our way. We only care to see men who can fight,
with whom we may try our luck." They will come
and work for Europeans, forming friendships among
them, and if it were not for the suspicion of those
who have not done so, who always fear political<a name="page51" id="page51"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;51]</span>
agents and spies, they would often be willing to
take Europeans through their land. I have more
than once been invited to go as a Moor. But the
ideas they get of Europeans in Tangier do not
predispose to friendship, and they will not allow
them to enter their territories if they can help it.
Only those who are in subjection to the Sultan
permit them to do so freely.</p>
<p>
The men are a hardy, sturdy race, wiry and lithe,
inured to toil and cold, fonder far of the gun and
sword than of the ploughshare, and steady riders of
an equally wiry race of mountain ponies. Their
dwellings are of stone and mud, often of two floors,
flat-topped, with rugged, projecting eaves, the roofs
being made of poles covered with the same material
as the walls, stamped and smoothed. These houses
are seldom whitewashed, and present a ruinous
appearance. Their ovens are domes about three
feet or less in height outside; they are heated by a
fire inside, then emptied, and the bread put in.
Similar ovens are employed in camp to bake for
the Court.</p>
<p>
Instead of that forced seclusion and concealment
of the features to which the followers of Islám elsewhere
doom their women, in these mountain homes
they enjoy almost as perfect liberty as their sisters
in Europe. I have been greatly struck with their
intelligence and generally superior appearance to
such Arab women as I have by chance been able
to see. Once, when supping with the son of a
powerful governor from above Fez, his mother,
wife, and wife's sister sat composedly to eat with
us, which could never have occurred in the dwelling
of a Moor. No attempt at covering their faces was<a name="page52" id="page52"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;52]</span>
made, though male attendants were present at times,
but the little daughter shrieked at the sight of a
Nazarene. The grandmother, a fine, buxom dame,
could read and write&mdash;which would be an astonishing
accomplishment for a Moorish woman&mdash;and she
could converse better than many men who would in
this country pass for educated.</p>
<p>
The Berber dress has either borrowed from or
lent much to the Moor, but a few articles stamp
it wherever worn. One of these is a large black
cloak of goat's-hair, impervious to rain, made of
one piece, with no arm-holes. At the point of the
cowl hangs a black tassel, and right across the back,
about the level of the knees, runs an assagai-shaped
patch, often with a centre of red. It has been
opined that this remarkable feature represents the
All-seeing Eye, so often used as a charm, but from
the scanty information I could gather from the
people themselves, I believe that they have lost
sight of the original idea, though some have told
me that variations in the pattern mark clan distinctions.
I have ridden&mdash;when in the guise of a
native&mdash;for days together in one of these cloaks,
during pelting rain which never penetrated it. In
more remote districts, seldom visited by Europeans,
the garments are ruder far, entirely of undyed wool,
and unsewn, mere blankets with slits cut in the
centre for the head. This is, however, in every
respect, a great difference between the various
districts. The turban is little used by these people,
skull-caps being preferred, while their red cloth
gun-cases are commonly twisted turban-wise as
head-gear, though often a camel's-hair cord is deemed
sufficient protection for the head.</p>

<a name="page53" id="page53"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;53]</span>
<p>
Every successive ruler of North Africa has had
to do with the problem of subduing the Berbers
and has failed. In the wars between Rome and
Carthage it was among her sturdy Berber soldiers
that the southern rival of the great queen city of
the world found actual sinews enough to hold the
Roman legions so long at bay, and often to overcome
her vaunted cohorts and carry the war across
into Europe. Where else did Rome find so near
a match, and what wars cost her more than did
those of Africa? Carthage indeed has fallen, and
from her once famed Byrsa the writer has been
able to count on his fingers the local remains of her
greatness, yet the people who made her what she
was remain&mdash;the Berbers of Tunisia. The Ph&oelig;nician
settlers, though bringing with them wealth
and learning and arts, could never have done alone
what they did without the hardy fighting men
supplied by the hills around.</p>
<p>
When Rome herself had fallen, and the fames
of Carthage and Utica were forgotten, there came
across North Africa a very different race from those
who had preceded them, the desert Arabs, introducing
the creed of Islám. In the course of a
century or two, North Africa became Mohammedan,
pagan and Christian institutions being swept away
before that onward wave. It is not probable that
at any time Christianity had any real hold upon
the Berbers themselves, and Islám itself sits lightly
on their easy consciences.</p>
<p>
The Arabs had for the moment solved the
Berber problem. They were the amalgam which,
by coalescing with the scattered factions of their
race, had bound them up together and had formed<a name="page54" id="page54"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;54]</span>
for once a nation of them. Thus it was that the
Muslim armies obtained force to carry all before
them, and thus was provided the new blood and the
active temper to which alone are due the conquest
of Spain, and subsequent achievements there. The
popular description of the Mohammedan rulers of
Spain as "Saracens"&mdash;Easterners&mdash;is as erroneous
as the supposition that they were Arabs. The
people who conquered Spain were Berbers, although
their leaders often adopted Arabic names with an
Arab religion and Arab culture. The Arabic
language, although official, was by no means
general, nor is it otherwise to-day. The men who
fought and the men who ruled were Berbers out
and out, though the latter were often the sons of
Arab fathers or mothers, and the great religious
chiefs were purely Arab on the father's side at
least, the majority claiming descent from Mohammed
himself, and as such forming a class apart of shareefs
or nobles.</p>
<p>
Though nominal Mohammedans, and in Morocco
acknowledging the religious supremacy of the reigning
shareefian family, the Moorish Berbers still
retain a semi-independence. The mountains of the
Atlas chain have always been their home and refuge,
where the plainsmen find it difficult and dangerous
to follow them. The history of the conquest of
Algeria and Tunisia by the French has shown
that they are no mean opponents even to modern
weapons and modern warfare. The Kabyles,<a name="IV1r" id="IV1r"></a><a href="#IV1"><sup>*</sup></a>
as they are erroneously styled in those countries,<a name="page55" id="page55"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;55]</span>
have still to be kept in check by the fear of
arms, and their prowess no one disputes. These
are the people the French propose to subdue by
"pacific penetration." The awe with which these
mountaineers have inspired the plainsmen and
townsfolk is remarkable; as good an illustration of
it as I know was the effect produced on a Moor by
my explanation that a Highland friend to whom I
had introduced him was not an Englishman, but
what I might call a "British Berber." The man
was absolutely awe-struck.</p>
<p>
Separated from the Arab as well as from the
European by a totally distinct, unwritten language,
with numerous dialects, these people still exist as a
mine of raw material, full of possibilities. In habits
and style of life they may be considered uncivilized
even in contrast to the mingled dwellers on the
lowlands; but they are far from being savages.
Their stalwart frames and sturdy independence fit
them for anything, although the latter quality keeps
them aloof, and has so far prevented intercourse
with the outside world.</p>
<p>
Many have their own pet theories as to the
origin of the Berbers and their language, not a
few believing them to have once been altogether
Christians, while others, following native authors,
attribute to them Canaanitish ancestors, and ethnologists
dispute as to the branch of Noah's family
in which to class them. It is more than probable
that they are one with the ancient Egyptians, who,
at least, were no barbarians, if Berbers. But all
are agreed that some of the finest stocks of southern
and western Europe are of kindred origin, if not<a name="page56" id="page56"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;56]</span>
identical with them, and even if this be uncertain,
enough has been said to show that they have
played no unimportant part in European history,
though it has ever been their lot to play behind the
scenes&mdash;scene-shifters rather than actors.</p>

<h2>THE WANDERING ARAB</h2>

<p class="center1">
"I am loving, not lustful."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>


<p>
Some strange fascination attaches itself to the simple
nomad life of the Arab, in whatever country he be
found, and here, in the far west of his peregrinations,
he is encountered living almost in the same
style as on the other side of Suez; his only roof
a cloth, his country the wide world. Sometimes the
tents are arranged as many as thirty or more in a
circle, and at other times they are grouped hap-hazard,
intermingled with round huts of thatch, and
oblong ones of sun-dried bricks, thatched also; but
in the latter cases the occupants are unlikely to
be pure Arabs, for that race seldom so nearly approaches
to settling anywhere. When the tents
are arranged in a circle, the animals are generally
picketed in the centre, but more often some are to
be found sharing the homes of their owners.</p>
<p>
The tent itself is of an oval shape, with a wooden
ridge on two poles across the middle third of the
centre, from front to back, with a couple of strong
bands of the same material as the tent fixed on
either side, whence cords lead to pegs in the
ground, passing over two low stakes leaning outwards.
A rude camel's hair canvas is stretched<a name="page58" id="page58"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;58]</span>
over this frame, being kept up at the edges by more
leaning stakes, and fastened by cords to pegs all
round. The door space is left on the side which
faces the centre of the encampment, and the walls
or "curtains" are formed of high thistles lashed
together in sheaves. Surrounding the tent is a
yard, a simple bog in winter, the boundary of which
is a ring formed by bundles of prickly branches,
which compose a really formidable barrier, being
too much for a jump, and too tenacious to one
another and to visitors for penetration. The break
left for an entrance is stopped at night by another
bundle which makes the circle complete.</p>
<p>
The interior of the tent is often more or less
divided by the pole supporting the roof, and by a
pile of household goods, such as they are. Sometimes
a rude loom is fastened to the poles, and at
it a woman sits working on the floor. The framework&mdash;made
of canes&mdash;is kept in place by rigging
to pegs in the ground. The woman's hand is her
only shuttle, and she threads the wool through with
her fingers, a span at a time, afterwards knocking
it down tightly into place with a heavy wrought-iron
comb about two inches wide, with a dozen
prongs. She seems but half-dressed, and makes no
effort to conceal either face or breast, as a filthy
child lies feeding in her lap. Her seat is a piece of
matting, but the principal covering for the floor of
trodden mud is a layer of palmetto leaves. Round
the "walls" are several hens with chicks nestling
under their wings, and on one side a donkey is
tethered, while a calf sports at large.</p>
<p>
The furniture of this humble dwelling consists
of two or three large, upright, mud-plastered,<a name="page59" id="page59"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;59]</span>
split-cane baskets, containing corn, partially sunk in
the ground, and a few dirty bags. On one side is the
mill, a couple of stones about eighteen inches across,
the upper one convex, with a handle at one side.
Three stones above a small hole in the ground serve
as a cooking-range, while the fuel is abundant in
the form of sun-dried thistles and other weeds, or
palmetto leaves and sticks. Fire is obtained by
borrowing from one another, but should it happen
that no one in the encampment had any, the
laborious operation of lighting dry straw from the
flash in the pan of a flint-lock would have to be
performed. To light the rude lamp&mdash;merely a bit
of cotton protruding from anything with olive-oil
in it&mdash;it is necessary to blow some smoking straw
or weed till it bursts into a flame.</p>
<p>
Little else except the omnipresent dirt is to be
found in the average Arab tent. A tin or two for
cooking operations, a large earthen water-jar, and a
pan or two to match, in which the butter-milk is kept,
a sieve for the flour, and a few rough baskets, usually
complete the list, and all are remarkable only for
the prevailing grime. Making a virtue of necessity,
the Arab prefers sour milk to fresh, for with this
almost total lack of cleanliness, no milk would long
keep sweet. Their food is of the simplest, chiefly
the flour of wheat, barley, or Indian millet prepared
in various ways, for the most part made up into flat,
heavy cakes of bread, or as kesk'soo. Milk, from
which butter is made direct by tossing it in a goat-skin
turned inside out, eggs and fowls form the chief
animal food, butcher's meat being but seldom indulged
in. Vegetables do not enter into their diet,
as they have no gardens, and beyond possessing<a name="page60" id="page60"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;60]</span>
flocks and herds, those Arabs met with in Barbary
are wretchedly poor and miserably squalid. The
patriarchal display of Arabia is here unknown.</p>
<p>
Of children and dogs there is no lack. Both
abound, and wallow in the mud together. Often
the latter seem to have the better time of it. Two
families by one father will sometimes share one tent
between them, but generally each "household" is
distinct, though all sleep together in the one apartment
of their abode. As one approaches a dûár,
or encampment, an early warning is given by
the hungry dogs, and soon the half-clad children
rush out to see who comes, followed leisurely by
their elders. Hospitality has ever been an Arab
trait, and these poor creatures, in their humble way,
sustain the best traditions of their race. A native
visitor of their own class is entertained and fed
by the first he comes across, while the foreign
traveller or native of means with his own tent is
accommodated on the rubbish in the midst of the
encampment, and can purchase all he wishes&mdash;all
that they have&mdash;for a trifle, though sometimes they
turn disagreeable and "pile it on." A present of
milk and eggs, perhaps fowls, may be brought, for
which, however, a <i>quid pro quo</i> is expected.</p>
<p>
Luxuries they have not. Whatever they need
to do in the way of shopping, is done at the nearest
market once a week, and nothing but the produce
already mentioned is to be obtained from them. In
the evenings they stuff themselves to repletion, if
they can afford it, with a wholesome dish of prepared
barley or wheat meal, sometimes crowned
with beans; then, after a gossip round the crackling
fire, or, on state occasions, three cups of syrupy<a name="page61" id="page61"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;61]</span>
green tea apiece, they roll themselves in their long
blankets and sleep on the ground.</p>
<p>
The first blush of dawn sees them stirring, and
soon all is life and excitement. The men go off to
their various labours, as do many of the stronger
women, while the remainder attend to their scanty
household duties, later on basking in the sun. But
the moment the stranger arrives the scene changes,
and the incessant din of dogs, hags and babies commences,
to which the visitor is doomed till late at
night, with the addition then of neighs and brays
and occasional cock-crowing.</p>
<p>
It never seemed to me that these poor folk
enjoyed life, but rather that they took things sadly.
How could it be otherwise? No security of life
and property tempts them to make a show of
wealth; on the contrary, they bury what little they
may save, if any, and lead lives of misery for fear
of tempting the authorities. Their work is hard;
their comforts are few. The wild wind howls
through their humble dwellings, and the rain
splashes in at the door. In sickness, for lack of
medical skill, they lie and perish. In health their
only pleasures are animal. Their women, once
they are past the prime of life, which means soon
after thirty with this desert race, go unveiled, and
work often harder than the men, carrying burdens,
binding sheaves, or even perhaps helping a donkey
to haul a plough. Female features are never so
jealously guarded here as in the towns.</p>
<p>
Yet they are a jolly, good-tempered, simple folk.
Often have I spent a merry evening round the fire
with them, squatted on a bit of matting, telling of
the wonders of "That Country," the name which<a name="page62" id="page62"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;62]</span>
alternates in their vocabulary with "Nazarene
Land," as descriptive of all the world but Morocco
and such portions of North Africa or Arabia as
they may have heard of. Many an honest laugh
have we enjoyed over their wordy tales, or perchance
some witty sally; but in my heart I have
pitied these down-trodden people in their ignorance
and want. Home they do not know. When the
pasture in Shechem is short, they remove to
Dothan; next month they may be somewhere
else. But they are always ready to share their
scanty portion with the wayfarer, wherever they
are.</p>
<p>
When the time comes for changing quarters
these wanderers find the move but little trouble.
Their few belongings are soon collected and packed,
and the tent itself made ready for transportation.
Their animals are got together, and ere long the
cavalcade is on the road. Often one poor beast
will carry a fair proportion of the family&mdash;the
mother and a child or two, for instance&mdash;in addition
to a load of household goods, and bundles of fowls
slung by their feet. At the side men and boys
drive the flocks and herds, while as often as not
the elder women-folk take a full share in the porterage
of their property. To meet such a caravan is
to feel one's self transported to Bible times, and to
fancy Jacob going home from Padan Aram.</p>

<h2>CITY LIFE</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Seek the neighbour before the house,
And the companion before the road."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Few countries afford a better insight into typical
Mohammedan life, or boast a more primitive civilization,
than Morocco, preserved as it has been so
long from western contamination. The patriarchal
system, rendered more or less familiar to us by our
Bibles, still exists in the homes of its people, especially
those of the country-side; but Moorish city
life is no less interesting or instructive. If an
Englishman's house is his castle, the Mohammedan's
house is a prison&mdash;not for himself, but
for his women. Here is the radical difference
between their life and ours. No one who has
not mixed intimately with the people as one of
themselves, lodging in their houses and holding
constant intercourse with them, can form an adequate
idea of the lack of home feeling, even in the
happiest families.</p>
<p>
The moment you enter a town, however, the
main facts are brought vividly before you on every
hand. You pass along a narrow thoroughfare&mdash;maybe
six, maybe sixteen feet in width&mdash;bounded
by almost blank walls, in some towns whitewashed,<a name="page64" id="page64"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;64]</span>
in others bare mud, in which are no windows,
lest their inmates might see or be seen. Even
above the roofs of the majority of two-storied houses
(for very many in the East consist but of ground
floor), the wall is continued to form a parapet round
the terrace. If you meet a woman in the street,
she is enveloped from head to ankle in close disguise,
with only a peep-hole for one or both eyes,
unless too ugly and withered for such precautions
to be needful.</p>
<p>
You arrive at the door of your friend's abode,
a huge massive barrier painted brown or green&mdash;if
not left entirely uncoloured&mdash;and studded all over
with nails. A very prison entrance it appears,
for the only other breaks in the wall above are
slits for ventilation, all placed so high in the room
as to be out of reach. In the warmer parts of the
country you would see latticed boxes protruding
from the walls&mdash;meshrabîyahs or drinking-places&mdash;shelves
on which porous earthen jars may be
placed to catch the slightest breeze, that the God-sent
beverage to which Mohammedans are wisely
restricted may be at all times cool. You are terrified,
if a stranger, by the resonance of this great
door, as you let the huge iron ring which serves
as knocker fall on the miniature anvil beneath it.
Presently your scattered thoughts are recalled by
a chirping voice from within&mdash;</p>
<p>
"Who's that?"</p>
<p>
You recognize the tones as those of a tiny
negress slave, mayhap a dozen years of age, and
as you give your name you hear a patter of bare
feet on the tiles within, but if you are a male,
you are left standing out in the street. In a few<a name="page65" id="page65"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;65]</span>
moments the latch of the inner door is sedately
lifted, and with measured tread you hear the
slippers of your friend advancing.</p>
<p>
"Is that So-and-so?" he asks, pausing on the
other side of the door.</p>
<p>
"It is, my Lord."</p>
<p>
"Welcome, then."</p>
<p>
The heavy bolt is drawn, and the door swings
on its hinges during a volley and counter-volley
of inquiries, congratulations, and thanks to God,
accompanied by the most graceful bows, the mutual
touching and kissing of finger-tips, and the placing
of hands on hearts. As these exercises slacken,
your host advances to the inner door, and possibly
disappears through it, closing it carefully behind
him. You hear his stentorian voice commanding,
"<i>Amel trek!</i>"&mdash;"Make way!"&mdash;and this is followed
by a scuffle of feet which tells you he is
being obeyed. Not a female form will be in sight
by the time your host returns to lead you in by
the hand with a thousand welcomes, entreating you
to make yourself at home.</p>
<p>
The passage is constructed with a double turn,
so that you could not look, if you would, from the
roadway into the courtyard which you now enter.
If one of the better-class houses, the floor will be
paved with marble or glazed mosaics, and in the
centre will stand a bubbling fountain. Round the
sides is a colonnade supporting the first-floor landing,
reached by a narrow stairway in the corner.
Above is the deep-blue sky, obscured, perhaps, by
the grateful shade of fig or orange boughs, or a
vine on a trellis, under which the people live. The
walls, if not tiled, are whitewashed, and often<a name="page66" id="page66"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;66]</span>
beautifully decorated in plaster mauresques. In
the centre of three of the four sides are huge horseshoe-arched
doorways, two of which will probably
be closed by cotton curtains. These suffice to
ensure the strictest privacy within, as no one would
dream of approaching within a couple of yards of a
room with the curtain down, till leave had been
asked and obtained.</p>
<p>
You are led into the remaining room, the guest-chamber,
and the curtain over the entrance is lowered.
You may not now venture to rise from your
seat on the mattress facing the door till the women
whom you hear emerging from their retreats have
been admonished to withdraw again. The long,
narrow apartment, some eight feet by twenty, in
which you find yourself has a double bed at each
end, for it is sleeping-room and sitting-room combined,
as in Barbary no distinction is known between
the two. However long you may remain, you see no
female face but that of the cheery slave-girl, who
kisses your hand so demurely as she enters with
refreshments.</p>
<p>
Thus the husband receives his friends&mdash;perforce
all males unless he be "on the spree,"&mdash;in
apartments from which all women-folk are banished.
Likewise the ladies of the establishment hold their
festive gatherings apart. Most Moors, however,
are too strict to allow much visiting among their
women, especially if they be wealthy and have a
good complexion, when they are very closely confined,
except when allowed to visit the bath at
certain hours set apart for the fair sex, or on
Fridays to lay myrtle branches on the tombs of
saints and departed relatives. Most of the ladies'<a name="page67" id="page67"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;67]</span>
calls are roof-to-roof visitations, and very nimble
they are in getting over the low partition walls,
even dragging a ladder up and down with them if
there are high ones to be crossed. The reason is
that the roofs, or rather terraces, are especially
reserved for women-folk, and men are not even
allowed to go up except to do repairs, when the
neighbouring houses are duly warned; it is illegal
to have a window overlooking another's roof.
David's temptation doubtless arose from his exercise
of a Royal exemption from this all-prevailing
custom.</p>
<p>
But for their exceedingly substantial build, the
Moorish women in the streets might pass for ghosts,
for with the exception of their red Morocco slippers,
their costume is white&mdash;wool-white. A long and
heavy blanket of coarse homespun effectually conceals
all features but the eyes, which are touched
up with antimony on the lids, and are sufficiently
expressive. Sometimes a wide-brimmed straw hat
is jauntily clapped on; but here ends the plate of
Moorish out-door fashions. In-doors all is colour,
light and glitter.</p>
<p>
In matters of colour and flowing robes the men
are not far behind, and they make up abroad for
what they lack at home. No garment is more
artistic, and no drapery more graceful, than that in
which the wealthy Moor takes his daily airing,
either on foot or on mule back. Beneath a gauze-like
woollen toga&mdash;relic of ancient art&mdash;glimpses of
luscious hue are caught&mdash;crimson and purple; deep
greens and "afternoon sun colour" (the native name
for a rich orange); salmons, and pale, clear blues. A
dark-blue cloak, when it is cold, negligently but<a name="page68" id="page68"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;68]</span>
gracefully thrown across the shoulders, or a blue-green
prayer-carpet folded beneath the arm, helps
to set off the whole.</p>
<p>
<i>Chez lui</i> our friend of the flowing garments is
a king, with slaves to wait upon him, wives to obey
him, and servants to fear his wrath. But his everyday
reception-room is the lobby of his stables,
where he sits behind the door in rather shabby
garments attending to business matters, unless he is
a merchant or shopkeeper, when his store serves
as office instead.</p>
<p>
If all that the Teuton considers essential to
home-life is really a <i>sine quâ non</i>, then Orientals
have no home-life. That is our way of looking
upon it, judging in the most natural way, by our
own standards. The Eastern, from his point of
view, forms an equally poor idea of the customs
which familiarity has rendered most dear to us. It
is as difficult for us to set aside prejudice and to consider
his systems impartially, as for him to do so
with regard to our peculiar style. There are but
two criteria by which the various forms of civilization
so far developed by man may be fairly judged.
The first is the suitability of any given form to the
surroundings and exterior conditions of life of the
nation adopting it, and the second is the moral or
social effect on the community at large.</p>
<p>
Under the first head the unbiassed student of
mankind will approve in the main of most systems
adopted by peoples who have attained that artificiality
which we call civilization. An exchange
among Westerners of their time-honoured habits
for those of the East would not be less beneficial or
more incongruous than a corresponding exchange<a name="page69" id="page69"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;69]</span>
on the part of orientals. Those who are ignorant
of life towards the sunrise commonly suppose that
they can confer no greater benefit upon the natives of
these climes than chairs, top-hats, and so on. Hardly
could they be more mistaken. The Easterner despises
the man who cannot eat his dinner without
a fork or other implement, and who cannot tuck his
legs beneath him, infinitely more than ill-informed
Westerners despise petticoated men and shrouded
women. Under the second head, however, a very
different issue is reached, and one which involves
not only social, but religious life, and consequently
the creed on which this last is based. It is in this
that Moorish civilization fails.</p>

   <hr class="short" />
<p>
But list! what is that weird, low sound which
strikes upon our ear and interrupts our musings?
It is the call to prayer. For the fifth time to-day
that cry is sounding&mdash;a warning to the faithful that
the hour for evening devotions has come. See!
yonder Moor has heard it too, and is already
spreading his felt on the ground for the performance
of his nightly orisons. Standing Mekka-wards,
and bowing to the ground, he goes through
the set forms used throughout the Mohammedan
world. The majority satisfy their consciences by
working off the whole five sets at once. But that
cry! I hear it still; as one voice fails another
carries on the strain in ever varying cadence, each
repeating it to the four quarters of the heavens.</p>
<p>
It was yet early in the morning when the first
call of the day burst on the stilly air; the sun had
not then risen o'er the hill tops, nor had his first,
soft rays dispelled the shadows of the night. Only<a name="page70" id="page70"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;70]</span>
the rustling of the wind was heard as it died among
the tree tops&mdash;that wind which was a gale last
night. The hurried tread of the night guard going
on his last&mdash;perhaps his only&mdash;round before returning
home, had awakened me from dreaming
slumbers, and I was about to doze away into that
sweetest of sleeps, the morning nap, when the
distant cry broke forth. Pitched in a high, clear
key, the Muslim confession of faith was heard;
"Lá iláha il' Al-lah; wa Mohammed er-rasool
Al-l-a-h!" Could ever bell send thrill like that?
I wot not.</p>

<h2>THE WOMEN-FOLK</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Teach not thy daughter letters; let her not live on the roof."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Of no country in the world can it more truly be
said than of the Moorish Empire that the social
condition of the people may be measured by that
of its women. Holding its women in absolute
subjection, the Moorish nation is itself held in subjection,
morally, politically, socially. The proverb
heading this chapter, implying that women should
not enjoy the least education or liberty, expresses
the universal treatment of the weaker sex among
Mohammedans. It is the subservient position of
women which strikes the visitor from Europe more
than all the oriental strangeness of the local customs
or the local art and colour. Advocates of the
restriction of the rights of women in our own land,
and of the retention of disabilities unknown to
men, who fail to recognize the justice and invariability
of the principle of absolute equality in rights
and liberty between the sexes, should investigate
the state of things existing in Morocco, where the
natural results of a fallacious principle have had free
course.</p>
<p>
No welcome awaits the infant daughter, and few
care to bear the evil news to the father, who will<a name="page72" id="page72"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;72]</span>
sometimes be left uninformed as to the sex of his
child till the time comes to name her. It is rarely
that girls are taught to read, or even to understand
the rudiments of their religious system. Here and
there a father who ranks in Morocco as scholarly,
takes the trouble to teach his children at home,
including his daughters in the class, but this is very
seldom the case. Only those women succeed in
obtaining even an average education in whom a
thirst for knowledge is combined with opportunities
in every way exceptional. In the country considerably
more liberty is permitted than in the
towns, and the condition of the Berber women has
already been noted.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, in certain circumstances, women
attain a power quite abnormal under such conditions,
usually the result of natural astuteness,
combined&mdash;at the outset, at least&mdash;with a reasonable
share of good looks, for when a woman is fairly
astute she is a match for a man anywhere. A
Mohammedan woman's place in life depends entirely
on her personal attractions. If she lacks
good looks, or is thin&mdash;which in Barbary, as in
other Muslim countries, amounts to much the same
thing&mdash;her future is practically hopeless. The
chances being less&mdash;almost <i>nil</i>&mdash;of getting her
easily off their hands by marriage, the parents feel
they must make the best they can of her by setting
her to work about the house, and she becomes a
general drudge. If the home is a wealthy one, she
may be relieved from this lot, and steadily ply her
needle at minutely fine silk embroidery, or deck and
paint herself in style, but, despised by her more
fortunate sisters, she is even then hardly better off.</p>

<a name="page73" id="page73"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;73]</span>
<p>
If, on the other hand, a daughter is the beauty
of the family, every one pays court to her in some
degree, for there is no telling to what she may
arrive. Perhaps, in Morocco, she is even thought
good enough for the Sultan&mdash;plump, clear-skinned,
bright-eyed. Could she but get a place in the Royal
hareem, it would be in the hands of God to make her
the mother of the coming sultan. But good looks
alone will not suffice to take her there. Influence&mdash;a
word translatable in the Orient by a shorter
one, cash&mdash;must be brought to bear. The interest
of a wazeer or two must be secured, and finally an
interview must take place with one of the "wise
women" who are in charge of the Imperial ladies.
She, too, must be convinced by the eloquence of
dollars, that His Majesty could not find another so
graceful a creature in all his dominions.</p>
<p>
When permission is given to send her to Court,
what joy there is, what bedecking, what congratulation!
At last she is taken away with a palpitating
heart, as she thinks of the possibilities before her,
bundled up in her blanket and mounted on an
ambling mule under strictest guard. On arrival
at her new home her very beauty will make
enemies, especially among those who have been
there longest, and who feel their chances grow
less as each new-comer appears. Perhaps one
Friday the Sultan notices her as he walks in his
grounds in the afternoon, and taking a fancy to
her, decides to make her his wife. At once all
jealousies are hidden, and each vies with the other
to render her service, and assist the preparations
for the coming event. For a while she will remain
supreme&mdash;a very queen indeed&mdash;but only till<a name="page74" id="page74"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;74]</span>
her place is taken by another. If she has sons her
chances are better; but unless she maintains her
influence over her husband till her offspring are old
enough to find a lasting place in his affections, she
will probably one day be despatched to Tafilált,
beyond the Atlas by the Sáharah, whence come
those luscious dates. There every other man is a
direct descendant of some Moorish king, as for
centuries it has served as a sort of overflow for the
prolific Royal house.</p>
<p>
As Islám knows no right of primogeniture, each
sultan appoints his heir; so each wife strives to
obtain this favour for her son, and often enough
the story of Ishmael and Isaac repeats itself among
these reputed descendants of Hagar. The usual
way is for the pet son to be placed in some command,
even before really able to discharge the
duties of the post, which shall secure him supreme
control on his father's death. The treasury and the
army are the two great means to this end. Those
possible rivals who have not been sent away to
Tafilált are as often as not imprisoned or put
to death on some slight charge, as used to be the
custom in England a few hundred years ago.</p>
<p>
This method of bequeathing rights which do
not come under the strict scale for the division of
property contained in the Korán is not confined
to Royalty. It applies also to religious sanctity.
An instance is that of the late Shareef, or Noble,
of Wazzán, a feudal "saint" of great influence.
His father, on his deathbed, appointed as successor
to his title, his holiness, and the estates connected
therewith, the son who should be found playing with
a certain stick, a common toy of his favourite. But<a name="page75" id="page75"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;75]</span>
a black woman by whom he had a son was present,
and ran out to place the stick in the hands of her
own child, who thus inherited his father's honours.
Some of the queens of Morocco have arrived at such
power through their influence over their husbands
that they have virtually ruled the Empire.</p>
<p>
Supposing, however, that the damsel who has at
last found admittance to the hareem does not, after
all, prove attractive to her lord, she will in all
probability be sent away to make room for some
one else. She will be bestowed upon some country
governor when he comes to Court. Sometimes
it is an especially astute one who is thus transferred,
that she may thereafter serve as a spy on
his actions.</p>
<p>
Though those before whom lies such a career as
has been described will be comparatively few, none
who can be considered beautiful are without their
chances, however poor. Many well-to-do men prefer
a poor wife to a rich one, because they can divorce
her when tired of her without incurring the enmity
of powerful relatives. Marriage is enjoined upon
every Muslim as a religious duty, and, if able to
afford it, he usually takes to himself his first wife
before he is out of his teens. He is relieved of the
choice of a partner which troubles some of us so
much, for the ladies of his family undertake this for
him: if they do not happen to know of a likely
individual they employ a professional go-between, a
woman who follows also the callings of pedlar and
scandal-monger. It is the duty of this personage,
on receipt of a present from his friends, to sing his
praises and those of his family in the house of some
beautiful girl, whose friends are thereby induced<a name="page76" id="page76"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;76]</span>
to give her a present to go and do likewise on
their behalf in the house of so promising a youth.
Personal negotiations will then probably take place
between the lady friends, and all things proving
satisfactory, the fathers or brothers of the might-be
pair discuss the dowry and marriage-settlement
from a strictly business point of view.</p>
<p>
At this stage the bride-elect will perhaps be
thought not fat enough, and will have to submit to
a course of stuffing. This consists in swallowing after
each full meal a few small sausage-shaped boluses
of flour, honey and butter, flavoured with anise-seed
or something similar. A few months of this
treatment give a marvellous rotundity to the figure,
thus greatly increasing her charms in the native eye.
But of these the bridegroom will see nothing, if not
surreptitiously, till after the wedding, when she is
brought to his house.</p>
<p>
By that time formal documents of marriage will
have been drawn up, and signed by notaries before
the kádi or judge, setting forth the contract&mdash;with
nothing in it about love or honour,&mdash;detailing every
article which the wife brings with her, including in
many instances a considerable portion of the household
utensils. Notwithstanding all this, she may be
divorced by her husband simply saying, "I divorce
thee!" and though she may claim the return of all
she brought, she has no option but to go home
again. He may repent and take her back a first
and a second time, but after he has put her away
three times he may not marry her again till after
she has been wedded to some one else and divorced.
Theoretically she may get a divorce from him, but
practically this is a matter of great difficulty.</p>

<a name="page77" id="page77"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;77]</span>
<p>
The legal expression employed for the nuptial
tie is one which conveys the idea of purchasing a
field, to be put to what use the owner will, according
him complete control. This idea is borne out to the
full, and henceforward the woman lives for her lord,
with no thought of independence or self-assertion.
If he is poor, all work too hard for him that is not
considered unwomanly falls to her share, hewing of
wood and drawing of water, grinding of corn and
making of bread, weaving and washing; but, strange
to us, little sewing. When decidedly <i>passée</i>, she
saves him a donkey in carrying wood and charcoal
and grass to market, often bent nearly double under
a load which she cannot lift, which has to be bound
on her back. Her feet are bare, but her sturdy
legs are at times encased in leather to ward off the
wayside thorns. No longer jealously covered, she
and her unmarried daughters trudge for many weary
miles at dawn, her decidedly better-off half and a son
or two riding the family mule. From this it is but
a short step to helping the cow or donkey draw the
plough, and this step is sometimes taken.</p>
<p>
Until a woman's good looks have quite disappeared,
which generally occurs about the time
they become grandmothers&mdash;say thirty,&mdash;intercourse
of any sort with men other than her relatives of the
first degree is strictly prohibited, and no one dare
salute a woman in the street, even if her attendant
or mount shows her to be a privileged relative.
The slightest recognition of a man out-of-doors&mdash;or
indeed anywhere&mdash;would be to proclaim herself
one of that degraded outcaste class as common in
Moorish towns as in Europe.</p>
<p>
Of companionship in wedlock the Moor has no<a name="page78" id="page78"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;78]</span>
conception, and his ideas of love are those of lust.
Though matrimony is considered by the Muslim
doctors as "half of Islám," its value in their eyes is
purely as a legalization of license by the substitution
of polygamy for polyandry. Slavishly bound to the
observance of wearisome customs, immured in a
windowless house with only the roof for a promenade,
seldom permitted outside the door, and then
most carefully wrapped in a blanket till quite unrecognizable,
the life of a Moorish woman, from the
time she has first been caught admiring herself in a
mirror, is that of a bird encaged. Lest she might
grow content with such a lot, she has before her
eyes from infancy the jealousies and rivalries of her
father's wives and concubines, and is early initiated
into the disgusting and unutterable practices employed
to gain the favour of their lord. Her one
thought from childhood is man, and distance lends
enchantment. A word, the interchange of a look,
with a man is sought for by the Moorish maiden
more than are the sighs and glances of a coy brunette
by a Spaniard. Nothing short of the unexpurgated
Arabian Nights' Entertainments can convey an adequate
idea of what goes on within those whited
sepulchres, the broad, blank walls of Moorish towns.
A word with the mason who comes to repair the
roof, or even a peep at the men at work on the
building over the way, on whose account the roof
promenade is forbidden, is eagerly related and expatiated
on. In short, all the training a Moorish
woman receives is sensual, a training which of itself
necessitates most rigorous, though often unavailing,
seclusion.</p>
<p>
Both in town and country intrigues are common,<a name="page79" id="page79"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;79]</span>
but intrigues which have not even the excuse of the
blindness of love, whose only motive is animal
passion. The husband who, on returning home,
finds a pair of red slippers before the door of his
wife's apartment, is bound to understand thereby
that somebody else's wife or daughter is within, and
he dare not approach. If he has suspicions, all he
can do is to bide his time and follow the visitor
home, should the route lie through the streets, or
despatch a faithful slave-girl or jealous concubine
on a like errand, should the way selected be over
the roof-tops. In the country, under a very different
set of conventionalities, much the same takes place.</p>
<p>
In a land where woman holds the degraded
position which she does under Islám, such family
circles as the Briton loves can never exist. The
foundation of the home system is love, which
seldom links the members of these families, most
seldom of all man and wife. Anything else is not
to be expected when they meet for the first time
on their wedding night. To begin with, no one's
pleasure is studied save that of the despotic master
of the house. All the inmates, from the poor imprisoned
wives down to the lively slave-girl who
opens the door, all are there to serve his pleasure,
and woe betide those who fail.</p>
<p>
The first wife may have a fairly happy time of it
for a season, if her looks are good, and her ways
pleasing, but when a second usurps her place, she
is generally cast aside as a useless piece of furniture,
unless set to do servile work. Although four
legal wives are allowed by the Korán, it is only
among the rich that so many are found, on account
of the expense of their maintenance in appropriate<a name="page80" id="page80"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;80]</span>
style. The facility of divorce renders it much
cheaper to change from time to time, and slaves
are more economical. To the number of such
women that a man may keep no limit is set; he
may have "as many as his right hand can possess."
Then, too, these do the work of the house, and if
they bear their master no children, they may be
sold like any other chattels.</p>
<p>
The consequence of such a system is that she
reigns who for the time stands highest in her lord's
favour, so that the strife and jealousies which disturb
the peace of the household are continual. This
rivalry is naturally inherited by the children, who
side with their several mothers, which is especially
the case with the boys. Very often the legal wife
has no children, or only daughters, while quite a
little troop of step-children play about her house.
In these cases it is not uncommon for at least the
best-looking of these youngsters to be taught to
call her "mother," and their real parent "Dadda
M'barkah," or whatever her name may be. The
offspring of wives and bondwomen stand on an
equal footing before the law, in which Islám is still
ahead of us.</p>
<p>
Such is the sad lot of women in Morocco.
Religion itself being all but denied them in practice,
whatever precept provides, it is with blank
astonishment that the majority of them hear the
message of those noble foreign sisters of theirs who
have devoted their lives to showing them a better
way. The greatest difficulty is experienced in
arousing in them any sense of individuality, any
feeling of personal responsibility, or any aspiration
after good. They are so accustomed to be treated
<a name="page81" id="page81"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;81]</span>
as cattle, that their higher powers are altogether
dormant, all possibilities of character repressed.
The welfare of their souls is supposed to be assured
by union with a Muslim, and few know even how
to pray. Instead of religion, their minds are
saturated with the grossest superstition. If this
be the condition of the free woman, how much
worse that of the slave!</p>
<p>
The present socially degraded state in which
the people live, and their apparent, though not real,
incapacity for progress and development, is to a
great extent the curse entailed by this brutalization
of women. No race can ever rise above the level
of its weaker sex, and till Morocco learns this lesson
it will never rise. The boy may be the father of
the man, but the woman is the mother of the boy,
and so controls the destiny of the nation. Nothing
can indeed be hoped for in this country in the
way of social progress till the minds of the men
have been raised, and their estimation of women
entirely changed. Though Turkey was so long
much in the position in which Morocco remains
to-day, it is a noteworthy fact that as she steadily
progresses in the way of civilization, one of the
most apparent features of this progress is the
growing respect for women, and the increasing
liberty which is allowed them, both in public and
private.</p>

<h2>SOCIAL VISITS<a name="VIII1r" id="VIII1r"></a><a href="#VIII1"><sup>*</sup></a></h2>

<p class="center1">
"Every country its customs."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
"Calling" is not the common, every-day event in
Barbary which it has grown to be in European
society. The narrowed-in life of the Moorish woman
of the higher classes, and the strict watch which is kept
lest some other man than her husband should see
her, makes a regular interchange of visits practically
impossible. No doubt the Moorish woman would
find them quite as great a burden as her western
sister, and in this particular her ignorance may be
greater bliss than her knowledge. In spite of the
paucity of the "calls" she receives or pays, she is
by no means ignorant of the life and character
of her neighbours, thanks to certain old women
(amongst them the professional match-makers) who
go about as veritable gossip-mongers, and preserve
their more cloistered sisters at least from
dying of inanition. Thus the veriest trifles of
house arrangement or management are thoroughly
canvassed.</p>
<p>
Nor is it a privilege commonly extended to
European women to be received into the hareems
of the high-class and wealthy Moors, although<a name="page83" id="page83"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;83]</span>
lady missionaries have abundant opportunities for
making the acquaintance of the women of the poorer
classes, especially when medical knowledge and skill
afford a key. But the wives of the rich are shut
away to themselves, and if you are fortunate enough
to be invited to call upon them, do not neglect your
opportunity.</p>
<p>
You will find that the time named for calling is
not limited to the afternoon. Thus it may be when
the morning air is blowing fresh from the sea, and
the sun is mounting in the heavens, that you are
ushered, perhaps by the master of the house, through
winding passages to the quarters of the women.
If there is a garden, this is frequently reserved for
their use, and jealously protected from view, and
as in all cases they are supposed to have the
monopoly of the flat roof, the courteous male
foreigner will keep his gaze from wandering thither
too frequently, or resting there too long.</p>
<p>
Do not be surprised if you are ushered into an
apparently empty room, furnished after the Moorish
manner with a strip of richly coloured carpet down
the centre, and mattresses round the edge. If there
is a musical box in the room, it will doubtless be
set going as a pleasant accompaniment to conversation,
and the same applies to striking or chiming
clocks, for which the Moors have a strong predilection
as <i>objets d'art</i>, rather than to mark the march
of time.</p>
<p>
Of course you will not have forgotten to remove
your shoes at the door, and will be sitting cross-legged
and quite at ease on one of the immaculate
mattresses, when the ladies begin to arrive from
their retreats. As they step forward to greet you,<a name="page84" id="page84"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;84]</span>you may notice their henna-stained feet, a means
of decoration which is repeated on their hands,
where it is sometimes used in conjunction with
harkos, a black pigment with which is applied a
delicate tracery giving the effect of black silk
mittens. The dark eyes are made to appear more
lustrous and almond-shaped by the application of
antimony, and the brows are extended till they
meet in a black line above the nose. The hair is
arranged under a head-dress frequently composed
of two bright-coloured, short-fringed silk handkerchiefs,
knotted together above the ears, sometimes
with the addition of an artificial flower: heavy
ear-rings are worn, and from some of them there
are suspended large silver hands, charms against
the "evil eye." But undoubtedly the main feature
of the whole costume is the kaftán or tunic of
lustrous satin or silk, embroidered richly in gold
and silver, of a colour showing to advantage beneath
a white lace garment of similar shape.</p>
<p>
The women themselves realize that such fine
feathers must be guarded from spot or stain, for
they are in many cases family heir-looms, so after
they have greeted you with a slight pressure of
their finger tips laid upon yours, and taken their
seats, tailor fashion, you will notice that each sedulously
protects her knees with a rough Turkish
towel, quite possibly the worse for wear. In spite
of her love for personal decoration, evidenced by
the strings of pearls with which her neck is entwined,
and the heavy silver armlets, the well-bred Moorish
woman evinces no more curiosity than her European
sister about the small adornments of her visitor,
and this is the more remarkable when you remember<a name="page85" id="page85"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;85]</span>
how destitute of higher interests is her life. She
will make kindly and very interested inquiries
about your relatives, and even about your life,
though naturally, in spite of your explanations, it
remains a sealed book to her. The average
Moorish woman, however, shows herself as inquisitive
as the Chinese.</p>
<p>
It is quite possible that you may see some of
the children, fascinating, dark-eyed, soft-skinned
morsels of humanity, with henna-dyed hair, which
may be plaited in a pig-tail, the length of which
is augmented by a strange device of coloured wool
with which the ends of the hair are interwoven.
But children of the better class in Morocco are
accustomed to keep in the background, and unless
invited, do not venture farther than the door of the
reception room, and then with a becoming modesty.
If any of the slave-wives enter, you will have an
opportunity of noticing their somewhat quaint greeting
of those whom they desire to honour, a kiss
bestowed on each hand, which they raise to meet
their lips, and upon each shoulder, before they,
too, take their seats upon the mattresses.</p>
<p>
Probably you will not have long to wait before
a slave-girl enters with the preparations for tea,
orange-flower water, incense, a well-filled tray, a
samovar, and two or three dishes piled high with
cakes. If you are wise, you will most assuredly
try the "gazelle's hoofs," so-called from their shape,
for they are a most delicious compound of almond
paste, with a spiciness so skilfully blended as to be
almost elusive. If you have a sweet tooth, the
honey cakes will be eminently satisfactory, but if
your taste is plainer, you will enjoy the f'kákis,<a name="page86" id="page86"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;86]</span>
or dry biscuit. Three cups of their most fragrant
tea is the orthodox allowance, but a Moorish host
or hostess is not slow to perceive any disinclination,
however slight, and will sometimes of his or her
own accord pave your way to a courteous refusal,
by appearing not over anxious either for the last
cup.</p>
<p>
If you have already had an experience of dining
in Morocco, the whole process of the tea-making
will be familiar; if not, you will be interested to
notice how the tea ("gunpowder") is measured in
the hand, then emptied into the pot, washed,
thoroughly sweetened, made with boiling water from
the samovar, and flavoured with mint or verbena.
If the master of the house is present, he is apt to
keep the tea-making in his own hands, although he
may delegate it to one of his wives, who thus becomes
the hostess of the occasion.</p>
<p>
After general inquiries as to the purpose of your
visit to Morocco, you may be asked if you are a
tabeebah or lady doctor, the one profession which
they know, by hearsay at least, is open to women.
If you can claim ever so little knowledge, you will
probably be asked for a prescription to promote an
increase of adipose tissue, which they consider their
greatest charm; perhaps a still harder riddle may
be propounded, with the hope that its satisfactory
solution may secure to them the wavering affection
of their lord, and prevent alienation and, perhaps,
divorce. Yet all you can say is, "In shá Allah"
(If God will!)</p>
<p>
When you bid them farewell it will be with a
keen realization of their narrow, cramped lives, and
an appreciation of your own opportunities.  Did<a name="page87" id="page87"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;87]</span>
you but know it, they too are full of sympathy
for that poor, over-strained Nazarene woman,
who is obliged to leave the shelter of her four
walls, and face the world unveiled, unprotected,
unabashed.</p>
<p>
And thus our proverb is proved true.</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<h2>A COUNTRY WEDDING</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Silence is at the door of consent."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Thursday was chosen as auspicious for the wedding,
but the ceremonies commenced on the Sunday
before. The first item on an extensive programme
was the visit of the bride with her immediate
female relatives and friends to the steam bath at
the kasbah, a rarity in country villages, in this
case used only by special favour. At the close
of an afternoon of fun and frolic in the bath-house,
Zóharah, the bride, was escorted to her home
closely muffled, to keep her bed till the following
day.</p>
<p>
Next morning it was the duty of Mokhtar, the
bridegroom, to send his betrothed a bullock, with
oil, butter and onions; pepper, salt and spices;
charcoal and wood; figs, raisins, dates and almonds;
candles and henna, wherewith to prepare the
marriage feast. He had already, according to the
custom of the country, presented the members of
her family with slippers and ornaments. As soon
as the bullock arrived it was killed amid great
rejoicings and plenty of "tom-tom," especially as
in the villages a sheep is usually considered sufficient
provision.  On this day Mokhtar's male<a name="page89" id="page89"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;89]</span>
friends enjoyed a feast in the afternoon, while in
the evening the bride had to undergo the process
of re-staining with henna to the accompaniment of
music. The usual effect of this was somewhat
counteracted, however, by the wails of those who
had lost relatives during the year. On each successive
night, when the drumming began, the same
sad scene was repeated&mdash;a strange alloy in all the
merriment of the wedding.</p>
<p>
On the Tuesday Zóharah received her maiden
friends, children attending the reception in the afternoon,
till the none too roomy hut was crowded to
suffocation, and the bride exhausted, although
custom prescribed that she should lie all day on
the bed, closely wrapped up, and seen by none of
her guests, from whom she was separated by a
curtain. Every visitor had brought with her some
little gift, such as handkerchiefs, candles, sugar, tea,
spices and dried fruits, the inspection of which,
when all were gone, was her only diversion that
day. Throughout that afternoon and the next the
neighbouring villages rivalled one another in peaceful
sport and ear-splitting ululation, as though, within
the memory of man, no other state of things had
ever existed between them.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Mokhtar had a more enlivening
time with his bachelor friends, who, after feasting
with him in the evening, escorted him, wrapped in
a háïk or shawl, to the house of his betrothed, outside
which they danced and played for three or four
hours by the light of lanterns. On returning home,
much fun ensued round the supper-basin on the
floor, while the palms of the whole company were
stained with henna. Then their exuberant spirits<a name="page90" id="page90"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;90]</span>
found relief in dancing round with basins on their
heads, till one of them dropped his basin, and
snatching off Mokhtar's cloak as if for protection,
was immediately chased by the others till supper
was ready. After supper all lay back to sleep. For
four days the bridegroom's family had thus to feast
and amuse his male friends, while the ladies were
entertained by that of the bride.</p>
<p>
On Wednesday came the turn of the married
women visitors, whose bulky forms crowded the
hut, if possible more closely than had their children.
Gossip and scandal were now retailed with a zest
and minuteness of detail not permissible in England,
while rival belles waged wordy war in shouts which
sounded like whispers amid the din. The walls of
the hut were hung with the brightest coloured
garments that could be borrowed, and the gorgeous
finery of the guests made up a scene of dazzling
colour. Green tea and cakes were first passed
round, and then a tray for offerings for the musicians,
which, when collected, were placed on the floor
beneath a rich silk handkerchief. Presents were
also made by all to the bride's mother, on behalf
of her daughter, who sat in weary state on the bed
at one end of the room. As each coin was put
down for the players, or for the hostess, a portly
female who acted as crier announced the sum contributed,
with a prayer for blessing in return, which
was in due course echoed by the chief musician.
At the bridegroom's house a similar entertainment
was held, the party promenading the lanes at dusk
with torches and lanterns, after which they received
from the bridegroom the powder for next
day's play.</p>

<br /><a name="caravan" id="caravan"></a><br />
<p class="center">

<b>A MOORISH CARAVAN.</b>
</p><br /><br />

<a name="page91" id="page91"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;91]</span>
<p>
Thursday opened with much-needed rest for
Zóharah and her mother till the time came for the
final decking; but Mokhtar had to go to the bath
with his bachelor friends, and on returning to his
newly prepared dwelling, to present many of them
with small coins, receiving in return cotton handkerchiefs
and towels, big candles and matches. Then
all sat down to a modest repast, for which he had
provided raisins and other dried fruits, some additional
fun being provided by a number of the
married neighbours, who tried in vain to gain
admission, and in revenge made off with other
people's shoes, ultimately returning them full of
dried fruits and nuts. Then Mokhtar's head was
shaved to the accompaniment of music, and the
barber was feasted, while the box in which the
bride was to be fetched was brought in, and decked
with muslin curtains, surmounted by a woman's
head-gear, handkerchiefs, and a sash. The box
was about two and a half feet square, and
somewhat more in height, including its pointed
top.</p>
<p>
After three drummings to assemble the friends, a
procession was formed about a couple of hours after
sunset, lit by torches, lanterns and candles, led by
the powder-players, followed by the mounted bridegroom,
and behind him the bridal box lashed on
the back of a horse; surrounded by more excited
powder-players, and closed by the musicians. As
they proceeded by a circuitous route the women
shrieked, the powder spoke, till all were roused
to a fitting pitch of fervour, and so reached the
house of the bride. "Behold, the bridegroom
cometh!"</p>

<a name="page92" id="page92"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;92]</span>
<p>
Presently the "litter" was deposited at the door,
Mokhtar remaining a short distance off, while the
huge old negress, who had officiated so far as mistress
of the ceremonies, lifted Zóharah bodily off the
bed, and placed her, crying, in the cage. In this
a loaf of bread, a candle, some sugar and salt had
been laid by way of securing good luck in her new
establishment. Her valuables, packed in another
box, were entrusted to the negress, who was to
walk by her side, while strong arms mounted her,
and lashed the "amariah" in its place. As soon as
the procession had reformed, the music ceased, and
a Fátihah<a name="IX1r" id="IX1r"></a><a href="#IX1"><sup>*</sup></a> was solemnly recited. Then they started
slowly, as they had come, Mokhtar leaving his bride
as she was ushered, closely veiled, from her box
into her new home, contenting himself with standing
by the side and letting her pass beneath his
arm in token of submission. The door was then
closed, and the bridegroom took a turn with his
friends while the bride should compose herself, and
all things be made ready by the negress. Later on
he returned, and being admitted, the newly married
couple met at last.</p>
<p>
Next day they were afforded a respite, but on
Saturday the bride had once more to hold a reception,
and on the succeeding Thursday came the
ceremony of donning the belt, a long, stiff band of
embroidered silk, folded to some six inches in
width, wound many times round. Standing over
a dish containing almonds, raisins, figs, dates, and
a couple of eggs, in the presence of a gathering
of married women, one of whom assisted in the
winding, two small boys adjusted the sash with<a name="page93" id="page93"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;93]</span>
all due state, after which a procession was
formed round the house, and the actual wedding
was over. Thus commenced a year's imprisonment
for the bride, as it was not till she was
herself a mother that she was permitted to revisit
her old home.</p>

<h2>THE BAIRNS</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Every monkey is a gazelle to its mother."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
If there is one point in the character of the Moor
which commends itself above others to the mind of
the European it is his love for his children. But
when it is observed that in too many cases this love
is unequally divided, and that the father prefers
his sons to his daughters, our admiration is apt to
wane. Though by no means an invariable rule,
this is the most common outcome of the pride felt
in being the father of a son who may be a credit to
the house, and the feeling that a daughter who has
to be provided for is an added responsibility.</p>
<p>
All is well when the two tiny children play
together on the floor, and quarrel on equal terms,
but it is another thing when little Hamed goes daily
to school, and as soon as he has learned to read is
brought home in triumph on a gaily dressed horse,
heading a procession of shouting schoolfellows,
while his pretty sister Fátimah is fast developing
into a maid-of-all-work whom nobody thinks of
noticing. And the distinction widens when Hamed
rides in the "powder-play," or is trusted to keep
shop by himself, while Fátimah is closely veiled
and kept a prisoner indoors, body and mind<a name="page95" id="page95"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;95]</span>
unexercised, distinguishable by colour and dress
alone from Habîbah, the ebony slave-girl, who
was sold like a calf from her mother's side. Yes,
indeed, far different paths lie before the two play-mates,
but while they are treated alike, let us take
a peep at them in their innocent sweetness.</p>
<p>
Their mother, Ayeshah, went out as usual one
morning to glean in the fields, and in the evening
returned with two bundles upon her back; the
upper one was to replace crowing Hamed in his
primitive cradle: it was Fátimah. Next day, as
Ayeshah set off to work again, she left her son
kicking up his heels on a pile of blankets, howling
till he should become acquainted with his new
surroundings, and a little skinny mite lay peacefully
sleeping where he had hitherto lived. No mechanical
bassinette ever swung more evenly, and no
soft draperies made a better cot than the sheet tied
up by the corners to a couple of ropes, and swung
across the room like a hammock. The beauty of it
was that, roll as he would, even active Hamed had
been safe in it, and all his energies only served to
rock him off to sleep again, for the sides almost
met at the top. Yet he was by no means dull, for
through a hole opposite his eye he could watch the
cows and goats and sheep as they wandered about
the yard, not to speak of the cocks and hens that
roamed all over the place.</p>
<p>
At last the time came when both the wee ones
could toddle, and Ayeshah carried them no more to
the fields astride her hips or slung over her shoulders
in a towel. They were then left to disport themselves
as they pleased&mdash;which, of course, meant
rolling about on the ground,&mdash;their garments tied up<a name="page96" id="page96"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;96]</span>
under their arms, leaving them bare from the waist.
No wonder that sitting on cold and wet stones had
threatened to shrivel up their thin legs, which looked
wonderfully shaky at best.</p>
<p>
It seems to be a maxim among the Moors that
neither head, arms nor legs suffer in any way from
exposure to cold or heat, and the mothers of the
poorer classes think nothing of carrying their
children slung across their backs with their little
bare pates exposed to the sun and rain, or of
allowing their lower limbs to become numbed with
cold as just described. The sole recommendation
of such a system is that only the fittest&mdash;in a certain
sense&mdash;survive. Of the attention supposed to be
bestowed in a greater or less degree upon all babes
in our own land they get little. One result, however,
is satisfactory, for they early give up yelling,
as an amusement which does not pay, and no one
is troubled to march them up and down for hours
when teething. Yet it is hardly surprising that
under such conditions infant mortality is very great,
and, indeed, all through life in this doctorless land
astonishing numbers are carried off by diseases we
should hardly consider dangerous.</p>
<p>
Beyond the much-enjoyed dandle on Father's
knee, or the cuddle with Mother, delights are few
in Moorish child-life, and of toys such as we have
they know nothing, whatever they may find to
take their place. But when a boy is old enough
to amuse himself, there is no end to the mischief
and fun he will contrive, and the lads of Barbary
are as fond of their games as we of ours. You
may see them racing about after school hours
at a species of "catch-as-catch-can," or playing<a name="page97" id="page97"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;97]</span>
football with their heels, or spinning tops, sometimes
of European make. Or, dearest sport of all, racing a
donkey while seated on its far hind quarters, with
all the noise and enjoyment we threw into such
pastimes a few years ago. To look at the merry
faces of these lively youths, and to hear their cheery
voices, is sufficient to convince anyone of their
inherent capabilities, which might make them
easily a match for English lads if they had their
chances.</p>
<p>
But what chances have they? At the age of
four or five they are drafted off to school, not to
be educated, but to be taught to read by rote, and
to repeat long chapters of the Korán, if not the
whole volume, by heart, hardly understanding what
they read. Beyond this little is taught but the four
great rules of arithmetic in the figures which we
have borrowed from them, but worked out in the
most primitive style. In "long" multiplication,
for instance, they write every figure down, and
"carry" nothing, so that a much more formidable
addition than need be has to conclude the calculation.
But they have a quaint system of learning their
multiplication tables by mnemonics, in which every
number is represented by a letter, and these being
made up into words, are committed to memory in
place of the figures.</p>
<p>
A Moorish school is a simple affair. No forms,
no desks, few books. A number of boards about
the size of foolscap, painted white on both sides, on
which the various lessons&mdash;from the alphabet to
portions of the Korán&mdash;are plainly written in large
black letters; a switch or two, a pen and ink and
a book, complete the furnishings. The dominie,<a name="page98" id="page98"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;98]</span>
squatted tailor-fashion on the ground, like his pupils,
who may number from ten to thirty, repeats the
lesson in a sonorous sing-song voice, and is imitated
by the little urchins, who accompany their voices
by a rocking to and fro, which occasionally enables
them to keep time. A sharp application of the
switch is wonderfully effectual in re-calling wandering
attention. Lazy boys are speedily expelled.</p>
<p>
On the admission of a pupil the parents pay
some small sum, varying according to their means,
and every Wednesday, which is a half-holiday, a
payment is made from a farthing to twopence. New
moons and feasts are made occasions for larger
payments, and count as holidays, which last ten
days on the occasion of the greater festivals.
Thursday is a whole holiday, and no work is done
on Friday morning, that being the Mohammedan
Sabbath, or at least "meeting day," as it is called.</p>
<p>
At each successive stage of the scholastic career
the schoolmaster parades the pupils one by one, if
at all well-to-do, in the style already alluded to,
collecting gifts from the grateful parents to supplement
the few coppers the boys bring to school week
by week. If they intend to become notaries or
judges, they go on to study at Fez, where they
purchase the key of a room at one of the colleges,
and read to little purpose for several years. In
everything the Korán is the standard work. The
chapters therein being arranged without any idea
of sequence, only according to length,&mdash;with the
exception of the Fátihah,&mdash;the longest at the beginning
and the shortest at the end, after the
first the last is learned, and so backwards to the
second.</p>

<a name="page99" id="page99"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;99]</span>
<p>
Most of the lads are expected to do something
to earn their bread at quite an early age, in one
way or another, even if not called on to assist their
parents in something which requires an old head
on young shoulders. Such youths being so early
independent, at least in a measure, mix with older
lads, who soon teach them all the vices they have
not already learned, in which they speedily become
as adept as their parents.</p>
<p>
Those intended for a mercantile career are put
into the shop at twelve or fourteen, and after some
experience in weighing-out and bargaining by the
side of a father or elder brother, they are left
entirely to themselves, being supplied with goods
from the main shop as they need them.</p>
<p>
It is by this means that the multitudinous little
box-shops which are a feature of the towns are
enabled to pay their way, this being rendered
possible by an expensive minutely retail trade.
The average English tradesman is a wholesale
dealer compared to these petty retailers, and very
many middle-class English households take in sufficient
supplies at a time to stock one of their shops.
One reason for this is the hand-to-mouth manner
in which the bulk of the people live, with no notion
of thrift. They earn their day's wage, and if
anything remains above the expense of living, it
is invested in gay clothing or jimcracks. Another
reason is that those who could afford it have seldom
any member of their household whom they can
trust as housekeeper, of which more anon.</p>
<p>
It seems ridiculous to send for sugar, tea, etc.,
by the ounce or less; candles, boxes of matches, etc.,
one by one; needles, thread, silk, in like proportion,<a name="page100" id="page100"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;100]</span>
even when cash is available, but such is the practice
here, and there is as much haggling over the price
of one candle as over that of an expensive article
of clothing. Often quite little children, who elsewhere
would be considered babes, are sent out to
do the shopping, and these cheapen and bargain like
the sharpest old folk, with what seems an inherent
talent.</p>
<p>
Very little care is taken of even the children
of the rich, and they get no careful training. The
little sons and daughters of quite important personages
are allowed to run about as neglected and
dirty as those of the very poor. Hence the practice
of shaving the head cannot be too highly
praised in a country where so much filth abounds,
and where cutaneous diseases of the worst type are
so frequent. It is, however, noteworthy that while
the Moors do not seem to consider it any disgrace
to be scarred and covered with disgusting sores,
the result of their own sins and those of their
fathers, they are greatly ashamed of any ordinary
skin disease on the head. But though the shaven
skulls are the distinguishing feature of the boys in
the house, where their dress closely resembles that
of their sisters, the girls may be recognized by their
ample locks, often dyed to a fashionable red with
henna; yet they, too, are often partially shaved,
sometimes in a fantastic style. It may be the hair
in front is cut to a fringe an inch long over the
forehead, and a strip a quarter of an inch wide is
shaved just where the visible part of a child's comb
would come, while behind this the natural frizzy
or straight hair is left, cut short, while the head is
shaved again round the ears and at the back of the
<a name="page101" id="page101"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;101]</span>
neck. To perform these operations a barber is
called in, who attends the family regularly. Little
boys of certain tribes have long tufts left hanging
behind their ears, and occasionally they also have
their heads shaved in strange devices.</p>
<p>
Since no attempt is made to bring the children
up as useful members of the community at the age
when they are most susceptible, they are allowed
to run wild. Thus, bright and tractable as they
are naturally, no sooner do the lads approach the
end of their 'teens, than a marked change comes
over them, a change which even the most casual
observer cannot fail to notice. The hitherto agreeable
youths appear washed-out and worthless. All
their energy has disappeared, and from this time
till a second change takes place for the worse, large
numbers drag out a weary existence, victims of
vices which hold them in their grip, till as if
burned up by a fierce but short-lived fire, they
ultimately become seared and shattered wrecks.
From this time every effort is made to fan the
flickering or extinguished flame, till death relieves
the weary mortal of the burden of his life.</p>

<h2>"DINING OUT"<a name="XIr" id="XIr"></a><a href="#XI"><sup>*</sup></a></h2>

<p class="center1">
"A good supper is known by its odour."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
There are no more important qualifications for the
diner-out in Morocco than an open mind and a
teachable spirit. Then start with a determination
to forget European table manners, except in so far
as they are based upon consideration for the feelings
of others, setting yourself to do in Morocco as the
Moors do, and you cannot fail to gain profit and
pleasure from your experience.</p>
<p>
One slight difficulty arises from the fact that it
is somewhat hard to be sure at any time that you
have been definitely invited to partake of a Moorish
meal. A request that you would call at three o'clock
in the afternoon, mid-way between luncheon and
dinner, would seem an unusual hour for a heavy
repast, yet that is no guarantee that you may not be
expected to partake freely of an elaborate feast.</p>
<p>
If you are a member of the frail, fair sex, the
absence of all other women will speedily arouse you
to the fact that you are in an oriental country, for
in Morocco the sons and chief servants, though they
eat after the master of the house, take precedence of
the wives and women-folk, who eat what remains of<a name="page103" id="page103"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;103]</span>
the various dishes, or have specially prepared meals
in their own apartments. For the same reason you
need not be surprised if you are waited upon after
the men of the party, though this order is sometimes
reversed where the host is familiar with European
etiquette with regard to women. If a man, perhaps
a son will wait upon you.</p>
<p>
The well-bred Moor is quite as great a stickler
for the proprieties as the most conservative Anglo-Saxon,
and you will do well if you show consideration
at the outset by removing your shoes at the
door of the room, turning a deaf ear to his assurance
that such a proceeding is quite unnecessary on your
part. A glance round the room will make it clear
that your courtesy will be appreciated, for the carpet
on the floor is bright and unmarked by muddy or
dusty shoes (in spite of the condition of the streets
outside), and the mattresses upon which you are
invited to sit are immaculate in their whiteness.</p>
<p>
Having made yourself comfortable, you will
admire the arrangements for the first item upon
the programme. The slave-girl appears with a
handsome tray, brass or silver, upon which there
are a goodly number of cups or tiny glass tumblers,
frequently both, of delicate pattern and artistic
colouring, a silver tea-pot, a caddy of green tea,
a silver or glass bowl filled with large, uneven lumps
of sugar, which have been previously broken off from
the loaf, and a glass containing sprigs of mint and
verbena. The brass samovar comes next, and having
measured the tea in the palm of his right hand, and
put it into the pot, the host proceeds to pour a small
amount of boiling water upon it, which he straightway
pours off, a precaution lest the Nazarenes should<a name="page104" id="page104"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;104]</span>
have mingled some colouring matter therewith. He
then adds enough sugar to ensure a semi-syrupy
result, with some sprigs of peppermint, and fills the
pot from the samovar. A few minutes later he pours
out a little, which he tastes himself, frequently returning
the remainder to the pot, although the more
Europeanized consume the whole draught. If the
test has been satisfactory, he proceeds to fill the
cups or glasses, passing them in turn to the guests
in order of distinction. To make a perceptible
noise in drawing it from the glass to the mouth
is esteemed a delicate token of appreciation.</p>
<p>
The tray is then removed; the slave in attendance
brings a chased brass basin and ewer of water,
and before the serious portion of the meal begins
you are expected to hold out your right hand just to
cleanse it from any impurities which may have been
contracted in coming. Orange-flower water in a
silver sprinkler is then brought in, followed by a brass
incense burner filled with live charcoal, on which a
small quantity of sandal-wood or other incense is
placed, and the result is a delicious fragrance which
you are invited to waft by a circular motion of your
hands into your hair, your ribbons and your laces,
while your Moorish host finds the folds of his loose
garments invaluable for the retention of the spicy
perfume.</p>
<p>
A circular table about eight inches high is then
placed in the centre of the guests; on this is placed
a tray with the first course of the dinner, frequently
puffs of delicate pastry fried in butter over a charcoal
fire, and containing sometimes meat, sometimes
a delicious compound of almond paste and cinnamon.
This, being removed, is followed by a succession of<a name="page105" id="page105"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;105]</span>
savoury stews with rich, well-flavoured gravies, each
with its own distinctive spiciness, but all excellently
cooked. The host first dips a fragment of bread
into the gravy, saying as he does so, "B'ísm Illah!"
("In the name of God!"), which the guests repeat,
as each follows suit with a sop from the dish.</p>
<p>
There is abundant scope for elegance of gesture
in the eating of the stews, but still greater opportunity
when the <i>pièce de résistance</i> of a Moorish
dinner, the dish of kesk'soo, is brought on. This
kesk'soo is a small round granule prepared from
semolina, which, having been steamed, is served
like rice beneath and round an excellent stew, which
is heaped up in the centre of the dish. With
the thumb and two first fingers of the right hand
you are expected to secure some succulent morsel
from the stew,&mdash;meat, raisins, onions, or vegetable
marrow,&mdash;and with it a small quantity of the kesk'soo.
By a skilful motion of the palm the whole is formed
into a round ball, which is thrown with a graceful
curve of hand and wrist into the mouth. Woe betide
you if your host is possessed by the hospitable
desire to make one of these boluses for you, for he
is apt to measure the cubic content of your mouth
by that of his own, and for a moment your feelings
will be too deep for words; but this is only a brief
discomfort, and you will find the dish an excellent
one, for Moorish cooks never serve tough meat.</p>
<p>
If your fingers have suffered from contact with
the kesk'soo, it is permitted to you to apply your
tongue to each digit in turn in the following order;
fourth (or little finger), second, thumb, third, first;
but a few moments later the slave appears, and after
bearing away the table with the remains of the feast<a name="page106" id="page106"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;106]</span>
gives the opportunity for a most satisfactory ablution.
In this case you are expected to use soap, and to
wash both hands, over which water is poured three
times. If you are at all acquainted with Moorish
ways, you will not fail at the same time to apply
soap and water to your mouth both outwardly and
inwardly, being careful to rinse it three times with
plenty of noise, ejecting the water behind your hand
into the basin which is held before you.</p>
<p>
Orange-flower water and incense now again
appear, and you may be required to drink three
more glasses of refreshing tea, though this is sometimes
omitted at the close of a repast. Of course
"the feast of reason and the flow of soul" have not
been lacking, and you have been repeatedly assured
of your welcome, and invited to partake beyond the
limit of human possibility, for the Moor believes
you can pay no higher compliment to the dainties
he has provided than by their consumption.</p>
<p>
For a while you linger, reclining upon the
mattress as gracefully as may be possible for a
tyro, with your arm upon a pile of many-coloured
cushions of embroidered leather or cloth. Then,
after a thousand mutual thanks and blessings,
accompanied by graceful bowings and bendings,
you say farewell and step to the door, where your
slippers await you, and usher yourself out, not ill-satisfied
with your initiation into the art of dining-out
in Barbary.</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<h2>DOMESTIC ECONOMY</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Manage with bread and butter till God sends the jam."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
If the ordinary regulations of social life among the
Moors differ materially from those in force among
ourselves, how much more so must the minor details
of the housekeeping when, to begin with, the husband
does the marketing and keeps the keys! And the
consequential Moor does, indeed, keep the keys, not
only of the stores, but also often of the house. What
would an English lady think of being coolly locked
in a windowless house while her husband went for
a journey, the provisions for the family being meanwhile
handed in each morning through a loophole
by a trusty slave left as gaoler? That no surprise
whatever would be elicited in Barbary by such an
arrangement speaks volumes. Woman has no voice
under Mohammed's creed.</p>
<p>
Early in the morning let us take a stroll into
the market, and see how things are managed there.
Round the inside of a high-walled enclosure is a
row of the rudest of booths. Over portions of the
pathway, stretching across to other booths in the
centre&mdash;if the market is a wide one&mdash;are pieces of
cloth, vines on trellis, or canes interwoven with
brushwood. As the sun gains strength these afford<a name="page108" id="page108"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;108]</span>
a most grateful shade, and during the heat of the
day there is no more pleasant place for a stroll, and
none more full of characteristic life. In the wider
parts, on the ground, lie heaps two or three feet
high of mint, verbena and lemon thyme, the much-esteemed
flavourings for the national drink&mdash;green-tea
syrup&mdash;exhaling a most delicious fragrance. It
is early summer: the luscious oranges are not yet
over, and in tempting piles they lie upon the
stalls made of old packing-cases, many with still
legible familiar English and French inscriptions.
Apricots are selling at a halfpenny or less the
pound, and plums and damsons, not to speak of
greengages, keep good pace with them in price and
sales. The bright tints of the lettuces and other
fresh green vegetables serve to set off the rich
colours of the God-made delicacies, but the prevailing
hue of the scene is a restful earth-brown, an
autumnal leaf-tint; the trodden ground, the sun-dried
brush-wood of the booths and awnings, and
the wet-stained wood-work. No glamour of paint
or gleam of glass destroys the harmony of the
surroundings.</p>
<p>
But with all the feeling of cool and repose, rest
there is not, or idleness, for there is not a brisker
scene in an oriental town than its market-place.
Thronging those narrow pathways come the rich
and poor&mdash;the portly merchant in his morning
cloak, a spotless white wool jelláb, with a turban
and girth which bespeak easy circumstances; the
labourer in just such a cloak with the hood up, but
one which was always brown, and is now much
mended; the slave in shirt and drawers, with a
string round his shaven pate; the keen little Jew<a name="page109" id="page109"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;109]</span>
boy pushing and bargaining as no other could; the
bearded son of Israel, with piercing eyes, and his
daughter with streaming hair; lastly, the widow or
time-worn wife of the poor Mohammedan, who must
needs market for herself. Her wrinkled face and
care-worn look tell a different tale from the pompous
self-content of the merchant by her side, who drives
as hard a bargain as she does. In his hand he
carries a palmetto-leaf basket, already half full,
as with slippered feet he carefully picks his way
among puddles and garbage.</p>
<p>
"Good morning, O my master; God bless
thee!" exclaims the stall-keeper as his customer
comes in sight.</p>
<p>
Sáïd el Faráji has to buy cloth of the merchant
time and time again, so makes a point of pleasing
one who can return a kindness.</p>
<p>
"No ill, praise God; and thyself, O Sáïd?"
comes the cheery reply; then, after five minutes'
mutual inquiry after one another's household, horses
and other interests, health and general welfare, friend
Sáïd points out the daintiest articles on his stall, and
in the most persuasive of tones names his "lowest
price."</p>
<p>
All the while he is sitting cross-legged on an old
box, with his scales before him.</p>
<p>
"What? Now, come, I'll give you <i>so</i> much,"
says the merchant, naming a price slightly less than
that asked.</p>
<p>
"Make it <i>so</i> much," exclaims Sáïd, even more
persuasively than before, as he "splits the difference."</p>
<p>
"Well, I'll give you <i>so</i> much," offering just a
little less than this sum. "I can't go above that,
you know."</p>

<a name="page110" id="page110"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;110]</span>

<p>
"All right, but you always get the better of me,
you know. That is just what I paid. Anyhow,
don't forget that when I want a new cloak," and
he proceeds to measure out the purchases, using as
weights two or three bits of old iron, a small cannon-ball,
some bullets, screws, coins, etc. "Go with
prosperity, my friend; and may God bless thee!"</p>
<p>
"And may God increase thy prosperity, and
grant to thee a blessing!" rejoins the successful
man, as he proceeds to another stall.</p>
<p>
By the time he reaches home his basket will
contain meat, fish, vegetables, fruit and herbs,
besides, perhaps, a loaf of sugar, and a quarter of
a pound of tea, with supplies of spices and some
candles. Bread they make at home.</p>
<p>
The absurdly minute quantities of what we
should call "stores," which a man will purchase
who could well afford to lay in a supply, seem very
strange to the foreigner; but it is part of his
domestic economy&mdash;or lack of that quality. He
will not trust his wife with more than one day's
supply at a time, and to weigh things out himself
each morning would be trouble not to be
dreamed of; besides which it would deprive him
of the pleasure of all that bargaining, not to speak
of the appetite-promoting stroll, and the opportunities
for gossip with acquaintances which it
affords. In consequence, wives and slaves are
generally kept on short allowances, if these are
granted at all.</p>
<p>
An amusing incident which came under my
notice in Tangier shows how little the English idea
of the community of interest of husband and wife
is appreciated here.  A Moorish woman who<a name="page111" id="page111"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;111]</span>
used to furnish milk to an English family being
met by the lady of the house one morning, when
she had brought short measure, said, pointing to
the husband in the distance, "<i>You</i> be my friend;
take this" (slipping a few coppers worth half a
farthing into her hand), "don't tell <i>him</i> anything
about it. I'll share the profit with you!" She
probably knew from experience that the veriest
trifle would suffice to buy over the wife of a Moor.</p>
<p>
Instructions having been given to his wife
or wives as to what is to be prepared, and how&mdash;he
probably pretends to know more of the art culinary
than he does&mdash;the husband will start off to attend to
his shop till lunch, which will be about noon. Then
a few more hours in the shop, and before the sun
sets a ride out to his garden by the river, returning
in time for dinner at seven, after which come talk,
prayers, and bed, completing what is more or less
his daily round. His wives will probably be
assisted in the house-work&mdash;or perhaps entirely
relieved of it&mdash;by a slave-girl or two, and the water
required will be brought in on the shoulders of a
stalwart negro in skins or barrels filled from some
fountain of good repute, but of certain contamination.</p>
<p>
In cooking the Moorish women excel, as their
first-rate productions afford testimony. It is the custom
of some Europeans to systematically disparage
native preparations, but such judges have been the
victims either of their own indiscretion in eating
too many rich things without the large proportion
of bread or other digestible nutriment which should
have accompanied them, or of the essays of their
own servants, usually men without any more knowledge
of how their mothers prepare the dishes they<a name="page112" id="page112"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;112]</span>
attempt to imitate than an ordinary English working
man would have of similar matters. Of course
there are certain flavourings which to many are
really objectionable, but none can be worse to us
than any preparation of pig would be to a Moor.
Prominent among such is the ancient butter which
forms the basis of much of their spicings, butter
made from milk, which has been preserved&mdash;usually
buried a year or two&mdash;till it has acquired the taste,
and somewhat the appearance, of ripe Gorgonzola.
Those who commence by trying a very slight flavour
of this will find the fancy grow upon them, and there
is no smell so absolutely appetizing as the faintest
whiff of anything being cooked in this butter, called
"smin."</p>
<p>
Another point, much misunderstood, which enables
them to cook the toughest old rooster or
plough-ox joint till it can be eaten readily with the
fingers, is the stewing in oil or butter. When the
oil itself is pure and fresh, it imparts no more taste
to anything cooked in it than does the fresh butter
used by the rich. Articles plunged into either at
their high boiling point are immediately browned
and enclosed in a kind of case, with a result which
can be achieved in no other manner than by rolling
in paste or clay, and cooking amid embers. Moorish
pastry thus cooked in oil is excellent, flaky and
light.</p>

<h2>THE NATIVE "MERCHANT"</h2>

<p class="center1">
"A turban without a beard shows lack of modesty."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Háj Mohammed Et-Tájir, a grey-bearded worthy,
who looks like a prince when he walks abroad, and
dwells in a magnificent house, sits during business
hours on a diminutive tick and wool mattress, on
the floor of a cob-webbed room on one side of an
ill-paved, uncovered, dirty court-yard. Light and
air are admitted by the door in front of which he
sits, while the long side behind him, the two ends,
and much of the floor, are packed with valuable
cloths, Manchester goods, silk, etc. Two other
sides of the court-yard consist of similar stores,
one occupied by a couple of Jews, and the other
by another fine-looking Háj, his partner.</p>
<p>
Enters a Moor, in common clothing, market
basket in hand. He advances to the entrance of
the store, and salutes the owner respectfully&mdash;"Peace
be with thee, Uncle Pilgrim!"</p>
<p>
"With thee be peace, O my master," is the
reply, and the new-comer is handed a cushion, and
motioned to sit on it at the door. "How doest
thou?" "How fares thy house?" "How dost
thou find thyself this morning?" "Is nothing
wrong with thee?" These and similar inquiries<a name="page114" id="page114"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;114]</span>
are showered by each on the other, and an equal
abundance is returned of such replies as, "Nothing
wrong;" "Praise be to God;" "All is well."</p>
<p>
When both cease for lack of breath, after a brief
pause the new arrival asks, "Have you any of
that 'Merican?" (unbleached calico). The dealer
puts on an indignant air, as if astonished at being
asked such a question. "<i>Have</i> I? There is no
counting what I have of it," and he commences to
tell his beads, trying to appear indifferent as to
whether his visitor buys or not. Presently the
latter, also anxious not to appear too eager, exclaims,
"Let's look at it." A piece is leisurely
handed down, and the customer inquires in a
disparaging tone, "How much?"</p>
<p>
"Six and a half," and the speaker again appears
absorbed in meditation.</p>
<p>
"Give thee six," says the customer, rising as if
to go.</p>
<p>
"Wait, thou art very dear to us; to thee alone
will I give a special price, six and a quarter."</p>
<p>
"No, no," replies the customer, shaking his
finger before his face, as though to emphasize his
refusal of even such special terms.</p>
<p>
"Al-l-láh!" piously breathes the dealer, as he
gazes abstractedly out of the door, presently adding
in the same devout tone, "There is no god but
God! God curse the infidels!"</p>
<p>
"Come, I'll give thee six and an okea"&mdash;of
which latter six and a half go to the 'quarter'
peseta or franc of which six were offered.</p>
<p>
"No, six and five is the lowest I can take."</p>
<p>
The might-be purchaser made his last offer in a
half-rising posture, and is now nearly erect as he<a name="page115" id="page115"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;115]</span>
says, "Then I can't buy; give it me for six and
three," sitting down as though the bargain were
struck.</p>
<p>
"No, I never sell that quality for less than six
and four, and it's a thing I make no profit on; you
know that."</p>
<p>
The customer doesn't look as though he did, and
rising, turns to go.</p>
<p>
"Send a man to carry it away," says the dealer.</p>
<p>
"At six and three!"</p>
<p>
"No, at six and four!" and the customer goes
away.</p>
<p>
"Send the man, it is thine," is hastily called
after him, and in a few moments he returns with a
Jewish porter, and pays his "six and three."</p>
<p>
So our worthy trader does business all day, and
seems to thrive on it. Occasionally a friend drops
in to chat and not to buy, and now and then there
is a beggar; here is one.</p>
<p>
An aged crone she is, of most forbidding countenance,
swathed in rags, it is a wonder she can keep
together. She leans on a formidable staff, and in a
piteous voice, "For the face of the Lord," and "In
the name of my Lord Slave-of-the-Able" (Mulai
Abd el Káder, a favourite saint), she begs something
"For God." One copper suffices to induce
her to call down untold blessings on the head of the
donor, and she trudges away in the mud, barefooted,
repeating her entreaties till they sound almost
a wail, as she turns the next corner. But beggars
who can be so easily disposed of at the rate of a
hundred and ninety-five for a shilling can hardly be
considered troublesome.</p>
<p>
A respectable-looking man next walks in with<a name="page116" id="page116"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;116]</span>
measured tread, and leaning towards us, says almost
in a whisper&mdash;</p>
<p>
"O Friend of the Prophet, is there anything
to-day?"</p>
<p>
"Nothing, O my master," is the courteously
toned reply, for the beggar appears to be a shareef
or noble, and with a "God bless thee," disappears.</p>
<p>
A miserable wretch now turns up, and halfway
across the yard begins to utter a whine which is
speedily cut short by a curt "God help thee!"
whereat the visitor turns on his heel and is gone.</p>
<p>
With a confident bearing an untidy looking
figure enters a moment later, and after due salaams
inquires for a special kind of cloth.</p>
<p>
"Call to-morrow morning," he is told, for he has
not the air of a purchaser, and he takes his departure
meekly.</p>
<p>
A creaky voice here breaks in from round the
corner&mdash;</p>
<p>
"Hast thou not a copper for the sake of the
Lord?"</p>
<p>
"No, O my brother."</p>
<p>
After a few minutes another female comes on
the scene, exhibiting enough of her face to show
that it is a mass of sores.</p>
<p>
"Only a trifle, in the name of my lord Idrees,"
she cries, and turns away on being told, "God
bring it!"</p>
<p>
Then comes a policeman, a makházni, who seats
himself amid a shower of salutations&mdash;</p>
<p>
"Hast thou any more of those selháms"
(hooded cloaks)?</p>
<p>
"Come on the morrow, and thou shalt see."</p>
<p>
The explanation of this answer given by the<a name="page117" id="page117"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;117]</span>
"merchant" is that he sees such folk only mean
to bother him for nothing.</p>
<p>
And this appears to be the daily routine of
"business," though a good bargain must surely be
made some time to have enabled our friend to
acquire all the property he has, but so far as an
outsider can judge, it must be a slow process.
Anyhow, it has heartily tired the writer, who has
whiled away the morning penning this account on a
cushion on one side of the shop described. Yet it
is a fair specimen of what has been observed by him
on many a morning in this sleepy land.</p>

<h2>SHOPPING<a name="XIV1r" id="XIV1r"></a><a href="#XIV1"><sup>*</sup></a></h2>

<p class="center1">
"Debt destroys religion."</p>
<p class="rindent">
 <i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
If any should imagine that time is money in
Morocco, let them undertake a shopping expedition
in Tangier, the town on which, if anywhere in
Morocco, occidental energy has set its seal. Not
that one such excursion will suffice, unless, indeed,
the purchaser be of the class who have more money
than wit, or who are absolutely at the mercy of the
guide and interpreter who pockets a commission
upon every bargain he brings about. For the
ordinary mortal, who wants to spread his dollars as
far as it is possible for dollars to go, a tour of inspection,
if not two or three, will be necessary
before such a feat can be accomplished. To be
sure, there is always the risk that between one
visit and another some coveted article may find
its way into the hands of a more reckless, or at
least less thrifty, purchaser, but that risk may be
safely taken.</p>

<b>A TUNISIAN SHOPKEEPER.</b>
</p><br /><br />

<p>
There is something very attractive in the small
cupboard-like shops of the main street.  Their<a name="page119" id="page119"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;119]</span>
owners sit cross-legged ready for a chat, looking
wonderfully picturesque in cream-coloured jelláb, or in
semi-transparent white farrajîyah, or tunic, allowing
at the throat a glimpse of saffron, cerise, or green
from the garment beneath. The white turban, beneath
which shows a line of red Fez cap, serves as
a foil to the clear olive complexion and the dark
eyes and brows, while the faces are in general goodly
to look upon, except where the lines have grown
coarse and sensuous.</p>
<p>
So strong is the impression of elegant leisure,
that it is difficult to imagine that these men expect
to make a living from their trade, but they are
more than willing to display their goods, and will
doubtless invite you to a seat upon the shop ledge&mdash;where
your feet dangle gracefully above a rough
cobble-stone pavement&mdash;and sometimes even to a
cup of tea. One after another, in quick succession,
carpets of different dimensions (but all oblong, for
Moorish rooms are narrow in comparison with their
length) are spread out in the street, and the shop-owners'
satellite, by reiterated cries of "Bálak!
Bálak!" (Mind out! Mind out!) accompanied by
persuasive pushes, keeps off the passing donkeys.
A miniature crowd of interested spectators will
doubtless gather round you, making remarks upon
you and your purchases. Charmed by the artistic
colourings, rich but never garish, you ask the
price, and if you are wise you will immediately offer
just half of that named. It is quite probable that
the carpets will be folded up and returned to their
places upon the shelf at the back of the shop, but it
is equally probable that by slow and tactful yielding
upon either side, interspersed with curses upon your<a name="page120" id="page120"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;120]</span>
ancestors and upon yourself, the bargain will be
struck about halfway between the two extremes.</p>
<p>
The same method must be adopted with every
article bought, and if you purpose making many
purchases in the same shop, you will be wise to obtain
and write down the price quoted in each case as "the
<i>very</i> lowest," and make your bid for the whole at
once, lest, made cunning by one experience of your
tactics, the shopman should put on a wider marginal
profit in every other instance to circumvent you.
It is also well for the purchaser to express ardent
admiration in tones of calm indifference, for the
Moor has quick perceptions, and though he may
not understand English, when enthusiasm is apparent,
he has the key to the situation, and refuses to
lower his prices.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it is sometimes difficult to avoid a
warm expression of admiration at the handsome
brass trays, the Morocco leather bags into which
such charming designs of contrasting colours are
skilfully introduced, or the graceful utensils of
copper and brass with which a closer acquaintance
was made when you were the guest at a Moorish
dinner. Many and interesting are the curious trifles
which may be purchased, but they will be found in
the greatest profusion in the bazaars established for
the convenience of Nazarene tourists, where prices
will frequently be named in English money, for an
English "yellow-boy" is nowhere better appreciated
than in Tangier.</p>
<p>
In the shops in the sôk, or market-place, prices
are sometimes more moderate, and there you may
discover some of the more distinctively Moorish
articles, which are brought in from the country;
<a name="page121" id="page121"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;121]</span>
nor can there be purchased a more interesting
memento than a flint-lock, a pistol, or a carved
dagger, all more or less elaborately decorated, such
as are carried by town or country Moor, the former
satisfied with a dagger in its chased sheath, except
at the time of "powder-play," when flint-locks are
in evidence everywhere.</p>
<p>
But in the market-place there are exposed for
sale the more perishable things of Moorish living.
Some of the small cupboards are grocers' shops,
where semolina for the preparation of kesk'soo,
the national dish, may be purchased, as well as
candles for burning at the saints' shrines, and a
multitude of small necessaries for the Moorish
housewives. In the centre of the market sit the
bread-sellers, for the most part women whose faces
are supposed to be religiously kept veiled from the
gaze of man, but who are apt to let their háïks
fall back quite carelessly when only Europeans
are near. An occasional glimpse may sometimes
be thus obtained of a really pretty face of some
lass on the verge of womanhood.</p>
<p>
Look at that girl in front of us, stooping over
the stall of a vendor of what some one has dubbed
"sticky nastinesses," her háïk lightly thrown
back; her bent form and the tiny hand protruding
at her side show that she is not alone, her
little baby brother proving almost as much as
she can carry. Her teeth are pearly white; her
hair and eyebrows are jet black; her nut-brown
cheeks bear a pleasant smile, and as she stretches
out one hand to give the "confectioner" a few
coppers, with the other clutching at her escaping
garment, and moves on amongst the crowd, we
<a name="page122" id="page122"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;122]</span>
come to the conclusion that if not fair, she is at
least comely.</p>
<p>
The country women seated on the ground with
their wares form a nucleus for a dense crowd. They
have carried in upon their backs heavy loads of
grass for provender, or firewood and charcoal which
they sell in wholesale quantities to the smaller shopkeepers,
who purchase from other countryfolk
donkey loads of ripe melons and luscious black
figs.</p>
<p>
There is a glorious inconsequence in the
arrangement of the wares. Here you may see a
pile of women's garments exposed for sale, and not
far away are sweet-sellers with honey-cakes and
other unattractive but toothsome delicacies. If
you can catch a glimpse of the native brass-workers
busily beating out artistic designs upon
trays of different sizes and shapes, do not fail to
seize the opportunity of watching them. You may
form one in the ring gathered round the snake-charmer,
or join the circle which listens open-mouthed
and with breathless attention to that story-teller,
who breaks off at a most critical juncture in
his narrative to shake his tambourine, declaring
that so close-fisted an audience does not deserve to
hear another word, much less the conclusion of his
fascinating tale.</p>
<p>
But before you join either party, indeed before
you mingle at all freely in the crowd upon a
Moorish market-place, it is well to remember that
the flea is a common domestic insect, impartial in
the distribution of his favours to Moor, Jew and
Nazarene, and is in fact not averse to "fresh fields
and pastures new."</p>

<a name="page123" id="page123"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;123]</span>
<p>
If you are clad in perishable garments, beware
of the water-carrier with his goat-skin, his tinkling
bell, his brass cup, and his strange cry. Beware,
too, of the strings of donkeys with heavily laden
packs, and do not scruple to give them a forcible
push out of your way. If you are mounted upon
a donkey yourself, so much the better; by watching
the methods of your donkey-boy to ensure a clear
passage for his beast, you will realize that dwellers
in Barbary are not strangers to the spirit of the
saying, "Each man for himself, and the de'il take
the hindmost."</p>
<p>
Yet they are a pleasant crowd to be amongst,
in spite of insect-life, water-carriers, and bulky pack-saddles,
and there is an exhaustless store of interest,
not alone in the wares they have for sale, and in
the trades they ply, but more than all in the faces,
so often keen and alert, and still more often bright
and smiling.</p>
<p>
One typical example of Moorish methods of
shopping, and I have done. Among those who
make their money by trade, you may find a man
who spends his time in bringing the would-be
purchaser into intimate relations with the article
he desires to obtain. He has no shop of his own,
but may often be recognized as an interested
spectator of some uncompleted bargain. Having
discovered your dwelling-place, he proceeds to
"bring the mountain to Mohammed," and you will
doubtless be confronted in the court-yard of your
hotel by the very article for which you have been
seeking in vain. Of course he expects a good price
which shall ensure him a profit of at least fifty per
cent. upon his expenditure, but he too is open to a<a name="page124" id="page124"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;124]</span>
bargain, and a little skilful pointing out of flaws in
the article which he has brought for purchase, in a
tone of calm and supreme indifference, is apt to
ensure a very satisfactory reduction of price in
favour of the shopper in Barbary.</p>

<h2>A SUNDAY MARKET</h2>

<p class="center1">
"A climb with a friend is a descent."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
One of the sights of Tangier is its market. Sundays
and Thursdays, when the weather is fine, see the
disused portion of the Mohammedan graveyard
outside <i>Báb el Fahs</i> (called by the English Port St.
Catherine, and now known commonly as the Sôk
Gate) crowded with buyers and sellers of most
quaint appearance to the foreign eye, not to mention
camels, horses, mules, and donkeys, or the goods
they have brought. Hither come the sellers from
long distances, trudging all the way on foot, laden
or not, according to means, all eager to exchange
their goods for European manufacturers, or to carry
home a few more dollars to be buried with their
store.</p>
<p>
Sunday is no Sabbath for the sons of Israel, so
the money-changers are doing a brisk trade from
baskets of filthy native bronze coin, the smallest of
which go five hundred to the shilling, and the
largest three hundred and thirty-three! Hard by
a venerable rabbi is leisurely cutting the throats
of fowls brought to him for the purpose by the
servants or children of Jews, after the careful inspection
enjoined by the Mosaic law. The old<a name="page126" id="page126"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;126]</span>
gentleman has the coolest way of doing it imaginable;
he might be only peeling an orange for the
little girl who stands waiting. After apparently all
but turning the victim inside out, he twists back its
head under its wings, folding these across its breast
as a handle, and with his free hand removing his
razor-like knife from his mouth, nearly severs its
neck and hands it to the child, who can scarcely
restrain its struggles except by putting her foot on
it, while he mechanically wipes his blade and prepares
to despatch another.</p>
<p>
Eggs and milk are being sold a few yards off by
country women squatted on the ground, the former
in baskets or heaps on the stones, the latter in uninviting
red jars, with a round of prickly-pear leaf
for a stopper, and a bit of palmetto rope for a
handle.</p>
<p>
By this time we are in the midst of a perfect
Babel&mdash;a human maëlstrom. In a European crowd
one is but crushed by human beings; here all
sorts of heavily laden quadrupeds, with packs often
four feet across, come jostling past, sometimes with
the most unsavoury loads. We have just time to
observe that more country women are selling
walnuts, vegetables, and fruits, on our left, at the
door of what used to be the tobacco and hemp
fandak, and that native sweets, German knick-knacks
and Spanish fruit are being sold on our
right, as amid the din of forges on either side
we find ourselves in the midst of the crush to get
through the narrow gate.</p>
<p>
Here an exciting scene ensues. Continuous
streams of people and beasts of burden are pushing
both ways; a drove of donkeys laden with rough<a name="page127" id="page127"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;127]</span>
bundles of cork-wood for the ovens approaches,
the projecting ends prodding the passers-by;
another drove laden with stones tries to pass
them, while half a dozen mules and horses vainly
endeavour to pass out. A European horseman
trots up and makes the people fly, but not so the
beasts, till he gets wedged in the midst, and must
bide his time after all. Meanwhile one is almost
deafened by the noise of shouting, most of it good-humoured.
"Zeed! Arrah!" vociferates the
donkey-driver. "Bálak!" shouts the horseman.
"Bálak! Guarda!" (pronounced warda) in a louder
key comes from a man who is trying to pilot a
Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary
through the gate, with Her Excellency on his
arm.</p>
<p>
At last we seize a favourable opportunity and
are through. Now we can breathe. In front of
us, underneath an arch said to have been built to
shelter the English guard two hundred years ago
(which is very unlikely, since the English destroyed
the fortifications of this gate), we see the native
shoeing-smiths hacking at the hoofs of horses,
mules, and donkeys, in a manner most extraordinary
to us, and nailing on triangular plates with holes in
the centre&mdash;though most keep a stock of English
imported shoes and nails for the fastidious Nazarenes.
Spanish and Jewish butchers are driving a
roaring trade at movable stalls made of old boxes,
and the din is here worse than ever.</p>
<p>
Now we turn aside into the vegetable market,
as it is called, though as we enter we are almost
sickened by the sight of more butchers' stalls, and
further on by putrid fish. This market is typical.<a name="page128" id="page128"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;128]</span>
Low thatched booths of branches and canes are
the only shops but those of the butchers, the arcade
which surrounds the interior of the building being
chiefly used for stores. Here and there a filthy
rag is stretched across the crowded way to keep
the sun off, and anon we have to stop to avoid
some drooping branch. Fruit and vegetables of
all descriptions in season are sold amid the most
good-humoured haggling.</p>
<p>
Emerging from this interesting scene by a gate
leading to the outer sôk, we come to one quite
different in character. A large open space is
packed with country people, their beasts and their
goods, and towns-people come out to purchase.
Women seem to far outnumber the men, doubtless
on account of their size and their conspicuous head-dress.
They are almost entirely enveloped in
white háïks, over the majority of which are thrown
huge native sun-hats made of palmetto, with four
coloured cords by way of rigging to keep the brim
extended. When the sun goes down these are to
be seen slung across the shoulders instead. Very
many of the women have children slung on their
backs, or squatting on their hips if big enough.
This causes them to stoop, especially if some other
burden is carried on their shoulders as well.</p>

<b>THE SUNDAY MARKET, TANGIER.</b>
</p><br /><br />
<p>
On our right are typical Moorish shops,&mdash;grocers',
if you please,&mdash;in which are exposed to
view an assortment of dried fruits, such as nuts,
raisins, figs, etc., with olive and argan oil, candles,
tea, sugar, and native soap and butter. Certainly
of all the goods that butter is the least inviting;
the soap, though the purest of "soft," looks a
horribly repulsive mass, but the butter which, like<a name="page129" id="page129"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;129]</span>
it, is streaked all over with finger marks, is in
addition full of hairs. Similar shops are perched
on our left, where old English biscuit-boxes are
conspicuous.</p>
<p>
Beyond these come slipper- and clothes-menders.
The former are at work on native slippers of such
age that they would long ago have been thrown
away in any less poverty-stricken land, transforming
them into wearable if unsightly articles,
after well soaking them in earthen pans. Just here
a native "medicine man" dispenses nostrums of
doubtful efficacy, and in front a quantity of red
Moorish pottery is exposed for sale. This consists
chiefly of braziers for charcoal and kesk'soo steamers
for stewing meat and vegetables as well.</p>
<p>
A native <i>café</i> here attracts our attention. Under
the shade of a covered way the káhwajî has a
brazier on which he keeps a large kettle of water
boiling. A few steps further on we light upon the
sellers of native salt. This is in very large crystals,
heaped in mule panniers, from which the dealers
mete it out in wooden measures. It comes from
along the beach near Old Tangier, where the heaps
can be seen from the town, glistening in the sunlight.
Ponds are dug along the shore, in which
sea water is enclosed by miniature dykes, and on
evaporating leaves the salt.</p>
<p>
Pressing on with difficulty through a crowd of
horses, mules and donkeys, mostly tethered by
their forefeet, we reach some huts in front of which
are the most gorgeous native waistcoats exposed
for sale, together with Manchester goods, by fat,
ugly old women of a forbidding aspect. Further
on we come upon "confectioners." A remarkable<a name="page130" id="page130"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;130]</span>
peculiarity of the tables on which the sweets are
being sold in front of us is the total absence of flies,
though bees abound, in spite of the lazy whisking
of the sweet-seller. The sweets themselves consist
of red, yellow and white sticks of what Cousin
Jonathan calls "candy;" almond and gingelly rock,
all frizzling in the sun. A small basin, whose
contents resemble a dark plum-pudding full of
seeds, contains a paste of the much-lauded hasheesh,
the opiate of Morocco, which, though contraband,
and strictly prohibited by Imperial decrees, is being
freely purchased in small doses.</p>
<p>
On the opposite side of the way some old
Spaniards are selling a kind of coiled-up fritter by
the yard, swimming in oil. Then we come to a
native restaurant. Trade does not appear very
brisk, so we shall not interrupt it by pausing for a
few moments to watch the cooking. In a tiny
lean-to of sticks and thatch two men are at work.
One is cutting up liver and what would be flead if
the Moors ate pigs, into pieces about the size of a
filbert. These the other threads on skewers in
alternate layers, three or four of each. Having
rolled them in a basin of pepper and salt, they are
laid across an earthen pot resembling a log scooped
out, like some primæval boat. In the bottom of
the hollow is a charcoal fire, which causes the
khotbán, as they are called, to give forth a most
appetizing odour&mdash;the only thing tempting about
them after seeing them made. Half loaves of
native bread lie ready to hand, and the hungry
passer-by is invited to take an <i>al fresco</i> meal for
the veriest trifle. Another sort of kabáb&mdash;for such
is the name of the preparation&mdash;is being made from<a name="page131" id="page131"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;131]</span>
a large wash-basin full of ready seasoned minced
meat, small handfuls of which the jovial <i>chef</i> adroitly
plasters on more skewers, cooking them like the
others.</p>
<p>
Squatted on the ground by the side of this
"bar" is a retailer of ripened native butter, "warranted
five years old." This one can readily smell
without stooping; it is in an earthenware pan, and
looks very dirty, but is weighed out by the ounce
as very precious after being kept so long underground.</p>
<p>
Opposite is the spot where the camels from and
for the interior load and unload. Some forty of
these ungainly but useful animals are here congregated
in groups. At feeding-time a cloth is
spread on the ground, on which a quantity of barley
is poured in a heap. Each animal lies with its legs
doubled up beneath it in a manner only possible
to camels, with its head over the food, munching
contentedly. In one of the groups we notice the
driver beating his beast to make it kneel down
preparatory to the removal of its pack, some two
hundred-weight and a half. After sundry unpleasant
sounds, and tramping backwards and
forwards to find a comfortable spot, the gawky
creature settles down in a stately fashion, packing
up his stilt-like legs in regular order, limb after
limb, till he attains the desired position. A short
distance off one of them is making hideous noises
by way of protest against the weight of the load
being piled upon him, threatening to lose his
temper, and throw a little red bladder out of his
mouth, which, hanging there as he breathes excitedly,
makes a most unpleasing sound.</p>

<a name="page132" id="page132"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;132]</span>
<p>
Here one of the many water-carriers who have
crossed our path does so again, tinkling his little
bell of European manufacture, and we turn to watch
him as he gives a poor lad to drink. Slung across
his back is the "bottle" of the East&mdash;a goat-skin
with the legs sewn up. A long metal spout is tied
into the neck, and on this he holds his left thumb,
which he uses as a tap by removing it to aim a long
stream of water into the tin mug in his right hand.
Two bright brass cups cast and engraved in Fez
hang from a chain round his neck, but these are
reserved for purchasers, the urchin who is now
enjoying a drink receiving it as charity. Tinkle,
tinkle, goes the bell again, as the weary man moves
on with his ever-lightening burden, till he is confronted
by another wayfarer who turns to him to
quench his thirst. As these skins are filled indiscriminately
from wells and tanks, and cleaned inside
with pitch, the taste must not be expected to satisfy
all palates; but if hunger is the best sauce for food,
thirst is an equal recommendation for drink.</p>
<p>
A few minutes' walk across a cattle-market
brings us at last to the English church, a tasteful
modern construction in pure Moorish style, and
banishing the thoughts of our stroll, we join the
approaching group of fellow-worshippers, for after
all it is Sunday.</p>

<h2>PLAY-TIME</h2>

<p class="center1">
"According to thy shawl stretch thy leg."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Few of us realize to what an extent our amusements,
pastimes, and recreations enter into the
formation of our individual, and consequently of our
national, character. It is therefore well worth our
while to take a glance at the Moor at play, or as
near play as he ever gets. The stately father of a
family must content himself, as his years and flesh
increase, with such amusements as shall not entail
exertion. By way of house game, since cards and
all amusements involving chance are strictly forbidden,
chess reigns supreme, and even draughts&mdash;with
which the denizens of the coffee-house, where
he would not be seen, disport themselves&mdash;are
despised by him. In Shiráz, however, the Sheïkh ul
Islám, or chief religious authority, declared himself
shocked when I told him how often I had played
this game with Moorish theologians, whereupon
ensued a warm discussion as to whether it was a
game of chance. At last I brought this to a satisfactory
close by remarking that as his reverence was
ignorant even of the rules of the game,&mdash;and therefore
no judge, since he had imagined it to be based
on hazard,&mdash;he at least was manifestly innocent of it.</p>

<a name="page134" id="page134"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;134]</span>
<p>
The connection between chess and Arabdom
should not be forgotten, especially as the very word
with which it culminates, "checkmate," is but a
corruption of the Arabic "sheïkh mát"&mdash;"chief
dead." The king of games is, however, rare on
the whole, requiring too much concentration for a
weary or lazy official, or a merchant after a busy
day. Their method of playing does not materially
differ from ours, but they play draughts with very
much more excitement and fun. The jocular vituperation
which follows a successful sally, and the
almost unintelligible rapidity with which the moves
are made, are as novel to the European as appreciated
by the natives.</p>
<p>
Gossip, the effervescence of an idle brain, is the
prevailing pastime, and at no afternoon tea-table in
Great Britain is more aimless talk indulged in than
while the cup goes round among the Moors. The
ladies, with a more limited scope, are not far
behind their lords in this respect. Otherwise their
spare time is devoted to minutely fine embroidery.
This is done in silk on a piece of calico or linen
tightly stretched on a frame, and is the same on
both sides; in this way are ornamented curtains,
pillow-cases, mattress-covers, etc. It is, nevertheless,
considered so far a superfluity that few who
have not abundant time to spare trouble about
it, and the material decorated is seldom worth the
labour bestowed thereon.</p>
<p>
The fact is that in these southern latitudes as
little time as possible is passed within doors, and
for this reason we must seek the real amusements
of the people outside. When at home they seem
to think it sufficient to loll about all the day long if<a name="page135" id="page135"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;135]</span>
not at work, especially if they have an enclosed
flower-garden, beautifully wild and full of green and
flowers, with trickling, splashing water. I exclude,
of course, all feasts and times when the musicians
come, but I must not omit mention of dancing.
Easterns think their western friends mad to dance
themselves, when they can so easily get others to
do it for them, so they hire a number of women to
go through all manner of quaint&mdash;too often indecent&mdash;posings
and wrigglings before them, to the tune
of a nasal chant, which, aided by fiddles, banjos,
and tambourines, is being drawled out by the
musicians. Some of these seemingly inharmonious
productions are really enjoyable when one gets into
the spirit of the thing.</p>
<p>
At times the Moors are themselves full of life
and vigour, especially in the enjoyment of what
may be called the national sport of "powder-play,"
not to speak of boar-hunting, hawking, rabbit-chasing,
and kindred pastimes. Just as in the days of
yore their forefathers excelled in the use of the
spear, brandishing and twirling it as easily as an
Indian club or singlestick, so they excel to-day in
the exercise of their five-foot flint-locks, performing
the most dexterous feats on horseback at full gallop.</p>
<p>
Here is such a display about to commence. It
is the feast of Mohammed's birthday, and the
market-place outside the gate, so changed since
yesterday, is crowded with spectators; men and
boys in gay, but still harmonious, colours, decked
out for the day, and women shrouded in their
blankets, plain wool-white. An open space is left
right through the centre, up a gentle slope, and a
dozen horsemen are spurring and holding in their<a name="page136" id="page136"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;136]</span>
prancing steeds at yonder lower end. At some unnoticed
signal they have started towards us. They
gallop wildly, the beat of their horses' hoofs sounding
as iron hail on the stony way. A cloud of dust flies
upward, and before we are aware of it they are
abreast of us&mdash;a waving, indistinguishable mass of
flowing robes, of brandished muskets, and of straining,
foaming steeds. We can just see them tossing
their guns in the air, and then a rider, bolder than
the rest, stands on his saddle, whirling round his
firearm aloft without stopping, while another swings
his long weapon underneath his horse, and seizes
it upon the other side. But now they are in line
again, and every gun is pointed over the right,
behind the back, the butt grasped by the twisted
left arm, and the lock by the right under the left
armpit. In this constrained position they fire at an
imaginary foe who is supposed to have appeared
from ambush as they pass. Immediately the reins&mdash;which
have hitherto been held in the mouth, the
steed guided by the feet against his gory flanks&mdash;are
pulled up tight, throwing the animal upon his
haunches, and wheeling him round for a sober walk
back.</p>
<p>
This is, in truth, a practice or drill for war, for
such is the method of fighting in these parts. A
sortie is made to seek the hidden foe, who may start
up anywhere from the ravines or boulders, and who
must be aimed at instanter, before he regains his
cover, while those who have observed him must as
quickly as possible get beyond his range to reload
and procure reinforcements.</p>
<p>
The only other active sports of moment, apart
from occasional horse races, are football and fencing,<a name="page137" id="page137"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;137]</span>
indulged in by boys. The former is played with a
stuffed leather ball some six or eight inches across,
which is kicked into the air with the back of the
heel, and caught in the hands, the object being to
drive it as high as possible. The fencing is only
remarkable for its free and easy style, and the
absence of hilts and guards.</p>
<p>
Yet there are milder pastimes in equal favour,
and far more in accordance with the fancy of
southerners in warm weather, such as watching a
group of jugglers or snake-charmers, or listening
to a story-teller. These are to be met with in the
market-place towards the close of hot and busy days,
when the wearied bargainers gather in groups to
rest before commencing the homeward trudge.
The jugglers are usually poor, the production of
fire from the mouth, of water from an empty jar,
and so on, forming stock items. But often fearful
realities are to be seen&mdash;men who in a frenzied state
catch cannon balls upon their heads, blood spurting
out on every side; or, who stick skewers through
their legs. These are religious devotees who live
by such performances. From the public <i>raconteur</i>
the Moor derives the excitement the European
finds in his novel, or the tale "to be continued in
our next," and it probably does him less harm.</p>

<h3>XVII</h3>

<h2>THE STORY-TELLER</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Gentleman without reading, dog without scent."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
The story-teller is, <i>par excellence</i>, the prince of
Moorish performers. Even to the stranger unacquainted
with the language the sight of the Arab
bard and his attentive audience on some erstwhile
bustling market at the ebbing day is full of interest&mdash;to
the student of human nature a continual attraction.
After a long trudge from home, commenced
before dawn, and a weary haggling over
the most worthless of "coppers" during the heat of
the day, the poor folk are quite ready for a quiet
resting-time, with something to distract their minds
and fill them with thoughts for the homeward way.
Here have been fanned and fed the great religious
and political movements which from time to time
have convulsed the Empire, and here the pulse of
the nation throbs. In the cities men lead a different
life, and though the townsfolk appreciate tales as
well as any, it is on these market-places that the
wandering troubadour gathers the largest crowds.</p>
<p>
Like public performers everywhere, a story-teller
of note always goes about with regular
assistants, who act as summoners to his entertainment,
and as chorus to his songs. They consist<a name="page139" id="page139"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;139]</span>
usually of a player on the native fiddle, another
who keeps time on a tambourine, and a third who
beats a kind of earthenware drum with his fingers.
Less pretentious "professors" are content with
themselves manipulating a round or square tambourine
or a two-stringed fiddle, and to many this
style has a peculiar charm of its own. Each pause,
however slight, is marked by two or three sharp
beats on the tightly stretched skin, or twangs with
a palmetto leaf plectrum, loud or soft, according
to the subject of the discourse at that point. The
dress of this class&mdash;the one most frequently met
with&mdash;is usually of the plainest, if not of the
scantiest; a tattered brown jelláb (a hooded woollen
cloak) and a camel's-hair cord round the tanned
and shaven skull are the garments which strike the
eye. Waving bare arms and sinewy legs, with a
wild, keen-featured face, lit up by flashing eyes,
complete the picture.</p>
<p>
This is the man from whom to learn of love
and fighting, of beautiful women and hairbreadth
escapes, the whole on the model of the "Thousand
Nights and a Night," of which versions more or
less recognizable may now and again be heard from
his lips. Commencing with plenty of tambourine,
and a few suggestive hints of what is to follow, he
gathers around him a motley audience, the first
comers squatting in a circle, and later arrivals
standing behind. Gradually their excitement is
aroused, and as their interest grows, the realistic
semi-acting and the earnest mien of the performer
rivet every eye upon him. Suddenly his wild
gesticulations cease at the entrancing point. One
step more for liberty, one blow, and the charming<a name="page140" id="page140"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;140]</span>
prize would be in the possession of her adorer.
Now is the time to "cash up." With a pious
reference to "our lord Mohammed&mdash;the prayer of
God be on him, and peace,"&mdash;and an invocation of a
local patron saint or other equally revered defunct,
an appeal is made to the pockets of the Faithful
"for the sake of Mulai Abd el Káder"&mdash;"Lord
Slave-of-the-Able." Arousing as from a trance,
the eager listeners instinctively commence to feel
in their pockets for the balance from the day's
bargaining; and as every blessing from the legion
of saints who would fill the Mohammedan calendar
if there were one is invoked on the cheerful giver,
one by one throws down his hard-earned coppers&mdash;one
or two&mdash;and as if realizing what he has parted
with, turns away with a long-drawn breath to untether
his beasts, and set off home.</p>
<p>
But exciting as are these acknowledged fictions,
specimens are so familiar to most readers from the
pages of the collection referred to that much more
interest will be felt in an attempt to reproduce one
of a higher type, pseudo-historical, and alleged to
be true. Such narratives exhibit much of native
character, and shades of thought unencountered
save in daily intercourse with the people. Let us,
therefore, seize the opportunity of a visit from a
noted <i>raconteur</i> and reputed poet to hear his story.
Tame, indeed, would be the result of an endeavour
to transfer to black and white the animated tones
and gestures of the narrator, which the imagination
of the reader must supply.</p>

<p>
The initial "voluntary" by the "orchestra" has
ended; every eye is directed towards the central
figure, this time arrayed in ample turban, white<a name="page141" id="page141"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;141]</span>
jelláb and yellow slippers, with a face betokening
a lucrative profession. After a moment's silence he
commences the history of&mdash;</p>


<h4>"<span class="sc">Mulai Abd el Káder and the Monk Of Monks</span>."</h4>
<p>
"The thrones of the Nazarenes were once in
number sixty, but the star of the Prophet of God&mdash;the
prayer of God be on him, and peace&mdash;was in the
ascendant, and the religion of Resignation [Islám]
was everywhere victorious. Many of the occupiers
of those thrones had either submitted to the
Lieutenant ['Caliph'] of our Lord, and become
Muslimeen, or had been vanquished by force of
arms. The others were terrified, and a general
assembly was convoked to see what was to be done.
As the rulers saw they were helpless against the
decree of God, they called for their monks to advise
them. The result of the conference was that it was
decided to invite the Resigned Ones (Muslimeen) to
a discussion on their religious differences, on the
understanding that whichever was victorious should
be thenceforth supreme.</p>
<p>
"The Leader of the Faithful having summoned
his wise men, their opinion was asked. 'O victorious
of God,' they with one voice replied, 'since God,
the High and Blessed, is our King, what have we
to fear? Having on our side the truth revealed in
the "Book to be Read" [the Korán] by the hand
of the Messenger of God&mdash;the prayer of God be on
him, and peace&mdash;we <i>must</i> prevail. Let us willingly
accept their proposal.' An early day was accordingly
fixed for the decisive contest, and each party
marshalled its forces. At the appointed time they
met, a great crowd on either side, and it was asked
which should begin. Knowing that victory was on
his side, the Lieutenant of the Prophet&mdash;the prayer
<a name="page142" id="page142"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;142]</span>
of God be on him, and peace&mdash;replied, 'Since ye
have desired this meeting, open ye the discussion.'</p>
<p>
"Then the chief of the Nazarene kings made
answer, 'But we are here so many gathered together,
that if we commence to dispute all round we shall
not finish by the Judgement Day. Let each party
therefore choose its wisest man, and let the two
debate before us, the remainder judging the result.'</p>
<p>
"'Well hast thou spoken,' said the Leader of
the Faithful; 'be it even so.' Then the learned
among the Resigned selected our lord Abd el
Káder of Baghdad,<a name="XVII1r" id="XVII1r"></a><a href="#XVII1"><sup>*</sup></a> a man renowned the world over
for piety and for the depth of his learning. Now a
prayer [Fátihah] for Mulai Abd el Káder!"</p>
<p>
Here the speaker, extending his open palms side
by side before him, as if to receive a blessing
thereon, is copied by the by-standers.<a name="XVII2r" id="XVII2r"></a><a href="#XVII2"><sup>&dagger;</sup></a> "In the
name of God, the Pitying, the Pitiful!" All draw
their hands down their faces, and, if they boast
beards, end by stroking them out.</p>
<p>
"Then the polytheists<a name="XVII3r" id="XVII3r"></a><a href="#XVII3"><sup>&Dagger;</sup></a> likewise chose their
man, one held among them in the highest esteem,
well read and wise, a monk of monks. Between
these two, then, the controversy commenced. As
already agreed, the Nazarene was the first to
question:</p>
<p>
"'How far is it from the Earth to the first
heaven?'</p>
<p>
"'Five hundred years.'</p>
<p>
"'And thence to the second heaven?'</p>
<p>
"'Five hundred years.'</p>
<p>
"'Thence to the third?'</p>

<a name="page143" id="page143"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;143]</span>
<p>
"'Five hundred years.'</p>
<p>
"'Thence to the fourth?'</p>
<p>
"'Five hundred years.'</p>
<p>
"'Thence to the fifth?'</p>
<p>
"'Five hundred years.'</p>
<p>
"'Thence to the sixth?'</p>
<p>
"'Five hundred years.'</p>
<p>
"'Thence to the seventh?'</p>
<p>
"'Five hundred years.'</p>
<p>
"'And from Mekka to Jerusalem?'</p>
<p>
"'Forty days.'</p>
<p>
"'Add up the whole.'</p>
<p>
"'Three thousand, five hundred years, and forty
days.'</p>
<p>
"'In his famous ride on El Borak [Lightning]
where did Mohammed go?'</p>
<p>
"'From the Sacred Temple [of Mekka] to the
Further Temple [of Jerusalem], and from the Holy
House [Jerusalem] to the seventh heaven, and the
presence of God.'<a name="XVII4r" id="XVII4r"></a><a href="#XVII4"><sup>&sect;</sup></a></p>
<p>
"'How long did this take?'</p>
<p>
"'The tenth of one night.'</p>
<p>
"'Did he find his bed still warm on his return?'</p>
<p>
"'Yes.'</p>
<p>
"'Dost thou think such a thing possible; to
travel three thousand five hundred years and back,
and find one's bed still warm on returning?'</p>
<p>
"'Canst thou play chess?' then asked Mulai
Abd el Káder.</p>
<p>
"'Of course I can,' said the monk, surprised.</p>
<p>
"'Then, wilt thou play with me?'</p>
<p>
"'Certainly not,' replied the monk, indignantly.
'Dost thou think me a fool, to come here to discuss
the science of religion, and to be put off with a
game of chess?'</p>

<a name="page144" id="page144"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;144]</span>
<p>
"'Then thou acknowledgest thyself beaten;
thou hast said thou couldst play chess, yet thou
darest not measure thy skill at it with me. Thy
refusal proves thy lie.'</p>
<p>
"'Nay, then, since thou takest it that way, I
will consent to a match, but under protest.'</p>
<p>
"So the board was brought, and the players
seated themselves. Move, move, move, went the
pieces; kings and queens, elephants, rooks, and
knights, with the soldiers everywhere. One by one
they disappeared, as the fight grew fast and furious.
But Mulai Abd el Káder had another object in
view than the routing of his antagonist at a game
of chess. By the exercise of his superhuman power
he transported the monk to 'the empty third' [of
the world], while his image remained before him at
the board, to all appearances still absorbed in the
contest.</p>
<p>
"Meanwhile the monk could not tell where he
was, but being oppressed with a sense of severe
thirst, rose from where he sat, and made for a rising
ground near by, whence he hoped to be able to
descry some signs of vegetation, which should
denote the presence of water. Giddy and tired out,
he approached the top, when what was his joy to
see a city surrounded by palms but a short way off!
With a cry of delight he quickened his steps and
approached the gate. As he did so, a party of
seven men in gorgeous apparel of wool and silk
came out of the gate, each with a staff in his hand.</p>
<p>
"On meeting him they offered him the salutation
of the Faithful, but he did not return it. 'Who
mayest <i>thou</i> be,' they asked, 'who dost not wish
peace to the Resigned?' [Muslimeen]. 'My Lords,'
he made answer, 'I am a monk of the Nazarenes,
I merely seek water to quench my thirst.'</p>
<p>
"'But he who comes here must resign himself
[to Mohammedanism] or suffer the consequences.<a name="page145" id="page145"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;145]</span>
Testify that 'There is no god but God, and
Mohammed is His Messenger!' 'Never,' he replied;
and immediately they threw him on the
ground and flogged him with their staves till he
cried for mercy. 'Stop!' he implored. 'I will
testify.' No sooner had he done so than they
ceased their blows, and raising him up gave him
water to drink. Then, tearing his monkish robe to
shreds, each deprived himself of a garment to dress
him becomingly. Having re-entered the city they
repaired to the judge.</p>
<p>
"'My Lord,' they said, 'we bring before thee
a brother Resigned, once a monk of the monks,
now a follower of the Prophet, our lord&mdash;the
prayer of God be on him, and peace. We pray
thee to accept his testimony and record it in due
form.'</p>
<p>
"'Welcome to thee; testify!' exclaimed the
kádi, turning to the convert. Then, holding up
his forefinger, the quondam monk witnessed to the
truth of the Unity [of God]. 'Call for a barber!'
cried the kádi; and a barber was brought. Seven
Believers of repute stood round while the deed was
done, and the convert rose a circumcised Muslim&mdash;blessed
be God.</p>
<p>
"Then came forward a notable man of that
town, pious, worthy, and rich, respected of all, who
said, addressing the kádi: 'My Lord&mdash;may God
bless thy days,&mdash;thou knowest, all these worthy ones
know, who and what I am. In the interests of
religion and to the honour of God, I ask leave to
adopt this brother newly resigned. What is mine
shall be his to share with my own sons, and the care
I bestow on them and their education shall be
bestowed equally on him. God is witness.' 'Well
said; so be it,' replied the learned judge; 'henceforth
he is a member of thy family.'</p>
<p>
"So to the hospitable roof of this pious one<a name="page146" id="page146"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;146]</span>
went the convert. A tutor was obtained for him,
and he commenced to taste the riches of the
wisdom of the Arab. Day after day he sat and
studied, toiling faithfully, till teacher after teacher
had to be procured, as he exhausted the stores of
each in succession. So he read: first the Book 'To
be Read' [the Korán], till he could repeat it faultlessly,
then the works of the poets, Kálûn, el Mikki,
el Bisri, and Sîdi Hamzah; then the 'Lesser' and
'Greater Ten.'<a name="XVII5r" id="XVII5r"></a><a href="#XVII5"><sup>||</sup></a> Then he commenced at Sîdi íbnu
Ashîr, following on through the Ajrûmiyah,<a name="XVII6r" id="XVII6r"></a><a href="#XVII6"><sup>&#35;</sup></a> and
the Alfîyah,<a name="XVII7r" id="XVII7r"></a><a href="#XVII7"><sup>**</sup></a> to the commentaries of Sîdi Khalîl, of
the Sheïkh el Bokhári, and of Ibnu Asîm, till there
was nothing left to learn.</p>
<p>
"Thus he continued growing in wisdom and
honour, the first year, the second year, the third
year, even to the twentieth year, till no one could
compete with him. Then the Judge of Judges of
that country died, and a successor was sought for,
but all allowed that no one's claims equalled those
of the erstwhile monk. So he was summoned to fill
the post, but was disqualified as unmarried. When
they inquired if he was willing to do his duty in this
respect, and he replied that he was, the father of
the most beautiful girl in the city bestowed her on
him, and that she might not be portionless, the chief
men of the place vied one with another in heaping
riches upon him. So he became Judge of Judges,
rich, happy, revered.</p>
<p>
"And there was born unto him one son, then a
second son, and even a third son. And there was
born unto him a daughter, then a second daughter,
and even a third daughter. So he prospered and
increased. And to his sons were born sons, one,
two, three, and four, and daughters withal. And his<a name="page147" id="page147"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;147]</span>
daughters were given in marriage to the elders of
that country, and with them it was likewise.</p>
<p>
"Now there came a day, a great feast day, when
all his descendants came before him with their compliments
and offerings, some small, some great, each
receiving tenfold in return, garments of fine spun
wool and silk, and other articles of value.</p>
<p>
"When the ceremony was over he went outside
the town to walk alone, and approached the spot
whence he had first descried what had so long
since been his home. As he sat again upon that
well-remembered spot, and glanced back at the
many years which had elapsed since last he was
there, a party of the Faithful drew near. He offered
the customary salute of 'Peace be on you,' but they
simply stared in return. Presently one of them
brusquely asked what he was doing there, and he
explained who he was. But they laughed incredulously,
and then he noticed that once again
he was clad in robe and cowl, with a cord round his
waist. They taunted him as a liar, but he re-affirmed
his statements, and related his history. He counted
up the years since he had resigned himself, telling
of his children and children's children.</p>
<p>
"'Wouldst thou know them if you sawst them?'
asked the strangers. 'Indeed I would,' was the
reply, 'but they would know me first.'</p>
<p>
"'And you are really circumcised? We'll see!'
was their next exclamation. Just then a caravan
appeared, wending its way across the plain, and the
travellers hailed it. As he looked up at the shout,
he saw Mulai Abd el Káder still sitting opposite
him at the chess-board, reminding him that it was
his move. He had been recounting his experiences
for the last half century to Mulai Abd el Káder
himself, and to the wise ones of both creeds who
surrounded them!</p>

<a name="page148" id="page148"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;148]</span>
<p>
"Indeed it was too true, and he had to acknowledge
that the events of a life-time had been crowded
into a period undefinably minute, by the God-sent
power of my lord Slave-of-the-Able [Mulai Abd
el Káder].</p>
<p>
"Now, where is the good man and true who
reveres the name of this holy one? Who will say
a prayer to Mulai Abd el Káder?" Here the
narrator extends his palms as before, and all follow
him in the motion of drawing them down his face.
"In the name of the Pitying and Pitiful! Now
another!" The performance is repeated.</p>
<p>
"Who is willing to yield himself wholly and
entirely to Mulai Abd el Káder? Who will dedicate
himself from the soles of his feet to the crown
of his head? Another prayer!" Another repetition
of the performance.</p>
<p>
"Now let those devoted men earn the effectual
prayers of that holy one by offering their silver in
his name. Nothing less than a peseta<a name="XVII8r" id="XVII8r"></a><a href="#XVII8"><sup>&dagger;&dagger;</sup></a> will do.
That's right," as one of the bystanders throws
down the coin specified.</p>
<p>
"Now let us implore the blessing of God and
Mulai Abd el Káder on the head of this liberal
Believer." The palm performance is once more
gone through. The earnestness with which he
does it this time induces more to follow suit, and
blessings on them also are besought in the same
fashion.</p>
<p>
"Now, my friends, which among you will do
business with the palms of all these faithful ones?
Pay a peseta and buy the prayers of them all.
Now then, deal them out, and purchase happiness."</p>

<p>
So the appeal goes wearisomely on. As no
more pesetas are seen to be forthcoming, a shift<a name="page149" id="page149"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;149]</span>
is made with reals&mdash;nominally 2&frac12;<i>d.</i> pieces&mdash;the
story-teller asking those who cannot afford more
to make up first one dollar and then another, turning
naïvely to his assistant to ask if they haven't
obtained enough yet, as though it were all for them.
As they reply that more is needed, he redoubles
his appeals and prayers, threading his way in and
out among the crowd, making direct for each well-dressed
individual with a confidence which renders
flight or refusal a shame. Meanwhile the "orchestra"
has struck up, and only pauses when the "professor"
returns to the centre of the circle to call
on all present to unite in prayers for the givers. A
few coppers which have been tossed to his feet are
distributed scornfully amongst half a dozen beggars,
in various stages of filthy wretchedness and deformity,
who have collected on the ground at one
side.</p>
<p>
Here a water-carrier makes his appearance,
with his goat-skin "bottle" and tinkling bell&mdash;a
swarthy Soudanese in most tattered garb. The
players and many listeners having been duly refreshed
for the veriest trifle, the performance continues.
A prayer is even said for the solitary
European among the crowd, on his being successfully
solicited for his quota, and another for his
father at the request of some of the crowd, who
style him the "Friend of the Moors."</p>
<p>
At last a resort is made to coppers, and when
the story-teller condescendingly consents to receive
even such trifles in return for prayers, from those
who cannot afford more, quite a pattering shower
falls at his feet, which is supplemented by a further
hand-to-hand collection. In all, between four and<a name="page150" id="page150"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;150]</span>
five dollars must have been received&mdash;not a bad
remuneration for an hour's work! Already the
ring has been thinning; now there is a general
uprising, and in a few moments the scene is completely
changed, the entertainer lost among the
entertained, for the sun has disappeared below yon
hill, and in a few moments night will fall.</p>

<h2>SNAKE-CHARMING</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Whom a snake has bitten starts from a rope."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Descriptions of this art remembered in a book
for boys read years before had prepared me for
the most wonderful scenes, and when I first watched
the performance with snakes which delights the
Moors I was disappointed. Yet often as I might
look on, there was nothing else to see, save in the
faces and gestures of the crowd, who with child-like
simplicity followed every step as though for
the first time. These have for me a never-ending
fascination. Thus it is that the familiar sounds of
rapid and spasmodic beating on a tambourine, which
tell that the charmer is collecting an audience,
still prove an irresistible attraction for me as well.
The ring in which I find myself is just a reproduction
of that surrounding the story-teller of yester-e'en,
but where his musicians sat there is a wilder
group, more striking still in their appearance.</p>
<p>
This time, also, the instruments are of another
class, two or three of the plainest sheep-skin tambourines
with two gut strings across the centre under
the parchment, which gives them a peculiar twanging
sound; and a couple of reeds, mere canes
pierced with holes, each provided with a mouthpiece<a name="page152" id="page152"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;152]</span>
made of half an inch of flattened reed. Nothing
is needed to add to the discord as all three are
vigorously plied with cheek and palm.</p>
<p>
The principal actor has an appearance of studied
weirdness as he gesticulates wildly and calls on God
to protect him against the venom of his pets. Contrary
to the general custom of the country, he has
let his black hair grow till it streams over his
shoulders in matted locks. His garb is of the
simplest, a dirty white shirt over drawers of similar
hue completing his outfit.</p>
<p>
Selecting a convenient stone as a seat, notebook
in hand, I make up my mind to see the thing
through. The "music" having continued five or
ten minutes with the desired result of attracting a
circle of passers-by, the actual performance is now
to commence. On the ground in the centre lies a
spare tambourine, and on one side are the two cloth-covered
bottle-shaped baskets containing the snakes.</p>
<p>
The chief charmer now advances, commencing
to step round the ring with occasional beats on his
tambourine, rolling his eyes and looking demented.
Presently, having reached a climax of rapid beating
and pacing, he suddenly stops in the centre with an
extra "bang!"</p>
<p>
"Now, every man who believes in our lord
Mohammed ben Aïsa,<a name="XVIII1r" id="XVIII1r"></a><a href="#XVIII1"><sup>*</sup></a> say with me a Fátihah."</p>
<p>
Each of the onlookers extending his palms side
by side before his face, they repeat the prayer
in a sing-song voice, and as it concludes with a
loud "Ameen," the charmer gives an agonized cry,
as though deeply wrought upon. "Ah Rijál el<a name="page153" id="page153"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;153]</span>
Blád" ("Oh Saints of the Town!"), he shouts, as
he recommences his tambourining, this time even
with increased vigour, beating the ground with his
feet, and working his body up and down in a most
extraordinary manner. The two others are also
playing, and the noise is deafening. The chief
figure appears to be raving mad; his starting eyes,
his lithe and supple figure, and his streaming hair,
give him the air of one possessed. His face is a
study, a combination of fierceness and madness,
yet of good-nature.</p>
<p>
At last he sinks down exhausted, but after a
moment rises and advances to the centre of the
circle, picking up a tambourine.</p>
<p>
"Now, Sîdi Aïsa"&mdash;turning to one of the
musicians, whom he motions to cease their din&mdash;"what
do you think happens to the man who puts
a coin in there? Why, the holy saint, our lord
Mohammed ben Aïsa, puts a ring round him like
that," drawing a ring round a stone on the ground.
"Is it not so?"</p>
<p>
"It is, Ameen," from Sidi Aïsa.</p>
<p>
"And what happens to him in the day time?"</p>
<p>
"He is in the hands of God, and his people
too."</p>
<p>
"And in the night time?"</p>
<p>
"He is in the hands of God, and his people
too."</p>
<p>
"And when at home?"</p>
<p>
"He is in the hands of God, and his people
too."</p>
<p>
"And when abroad?"</p>
<p>
"He is in the hands of God, and his people
too."</p>

<a name="page154" id="page154"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;154]</span>
<p>
At this a copper coin is thrown into the ring,
and the charmer replies, "Now he who is master of
sea and land, my lord Abd el Káder el Jîláni,<a name="XVIII2r" id="XVIII2r"></a><a href="#XVIII2"><sup>&dagger;</sup></a> bless
the giver of that coin! Now, for the love of God
and of His blessed prophet, I offer a prayer for
that generous one." Here the operation of passing
their hands down their faces is performed by all.</p>
<p>
"Now, there's another,"&mdash;as a coin falls&mdash;"and
from a child, too! God bless thee now, my son.
May my lord Ben Aïsa, my lord Abd es-Slám, and
my lord Abd el Káder, protect and keep thee!"</p>
<p>
Then, as more coppers fall, similar blessings
are invoked upon the donors, interspersed with
catechising of the musicians with a view to making
known the advantages to be reaped by giving
something. At last, as nothing more seems to be
forthcoming, the performance proper is proceeded
with, and the charmer commences to dance on one
leg, to a terrible din from the tambourines. Then
he pauses, and summons a little boy from the
audience, seating him in the midst, adjuring him
to behave himself, to do as he is bid, and to have
faith in "our lord Ben Aïsa." Then, seating himself
behind the boy, he places his lips against his
skull, and blows repeatedly, coming round to the
front to look at the lad, to see if he is sufficiently
affected, and returning to puff again. Finally he
bites off a piece of the boy's cloak, and chews it.
Now he wets his finger in his mouth, and after
putting it into the dust makes lines across his legs
and arms, all the time calling on his patron saint;
next holding the piece of cloth in his hands and
walking round the ring for all to see it.</p>

<a name="page155" id="page155"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;155]</span>
<p>
"Come hither," he says to a bystander; "search
my mouth and see if there be anything there."</p>
<p>
The search is conducted as a farmer would
examine a horse's mouth, with the result that it is
declared empty.</p>
<p>
"Now I call on the prophet to witness that
there is no deception," as he once more restores the
piece of cloth to his mouth, and pokes his fingers
into his neck, drawing them now up his face.</p>
<p>
"Enough!"</p>
<p>
The voices of the musicians, who have for the
latter part of the time been giving forth a drawling
chorus, cease, but the din of the tambourines continues,
while the performer dances wildly, till he
stops before the lad on the ground, and takes from
his mouth first one date and then another, which
the lad is told to eat, and does so, the on-lookers
fully convinced that they were transformed from
the rag.</p>
<p>
Now it is the turn of one of the musicians to
come forward, his place being taken by the retiring
performer, after he has made another collection in
the manner already described.</p>
<p>
"He who believes in God and in the power
of our lord Mohammed ben Aïsa, say with me a
Fátihah," cries the new man, extending his palms
turned upwards before him to receive the blessings
he asks, and then brings one of the snake-baskets
forward, plunging his hand into its sack-like mouth,
and sharply drawing it out a time or two, as if
afraid of being bitten.</p>
<p>
Finally he pulls the head of one of the reptiles
through, and leaves it there, darting out its fangs,
while he snatches up and wildly beats the tambourine<a name="page156" id="page156"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;156]</span>
by his side. He now seizes the snake by the neck,
and pulls it right out, the people starting back as
it coils round in the ring, or uncoils and makes
a plunge towards someone. Now he pulls out
another, and hangs it round his neck, saying, "I
take refuge with the saint who was dead and is
alive, with our lord Mohammed son of Aïsa, and
with the most holy Abd el Káder el Jîláni, king of
land and sea. Now, let every one who believes
bear witness with me and say a Fátihah!"</p>
<p>
"Say a Fátihah!" echoes one of the still noisy
musicians, by way of chorus.</p>
<p>
"Now may our lord Abd el Káder see the man
who makes a contribution with his eyes."</p>
<p>
<i>Chorus:</i> "With his eyes!"</p>
<p>
"And may his heart find rest, and our lord
Abd er-Rahmán protect him!"</p>
<p>
<i>Chorus:</i> "Protect him!"</p>
<p>
"Now, I call you to witness, I bargain with our
lord Abd el Káder for a forfeit!"</p>
<p>
<i>Chorus:</i> "For a forfeit!"</p>
<p>
A copper is thrown into the ring, and as he
picks it up and hands it to the musician, the performer
exclaims&mdash;</p>
<p>
"Take this, see, and at the last day may the
giver of it see our lord Abd el Káder before him!"</p>
<p>
<i>Chorus:</i> "Before him!"</p>
<p>
"May he ever be blessed, whether present or
absent!"</p>
<p>
<i>Chorus:</i> "Present or absent!"</p>
<p>
"Who wishes to have a good conscience and a
clean heart? Oh, ye beloved of the Lord! See,
take from that dear one" (who has thrown down a
copper).</p>

<a name="page157" id="page157"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;157]</span>
<p>
The contributions now apparently sufficing for
the present, the performance proceeds, but the
crowd having edged a little too close, it is first
necessary to increase the space in the centre by
swinging one of the reptiles round by the tail,
whereat all start back.</p>
<p>
"Ah! you may well be afraid!" exclaims the
charmer. "Their fangs mean death, if you only
knew it, but for the mercies of my lord, the son of
Aïsa."</p>
<p>
"Ameen!" responds the chorus.</p>
<p>
Hereupon he proceeds to direct the head of the
snake to his mouth, and caressingly invites it to
enter. Darting from side to side, it finally makes a
plunge down his throat, whereon the strangers
shudder, and the <i>habitués</i> look with triumphant
awe. Wildly he spins on one foot that all may see,
still holding the creature by the neck with one hand,
and by the tail with the other. At length, having
allowed the greater part of its length to disappear
in this uncanny manner, he proceeds to withdraw it,
the head emerging with the sound of a cork from a
bottle. The sight has not been pleasant, but the
audience, transfixed, gives a sigh of relief as the
tambourines strike up again, and the reed chimes in
deafeningly.</p>
<p>
"Who says they are harmless? Who says their
fangs are extracted?" challenges the performer.
"Look here!"</p>
<p>
The seemingly angry snake has now fastened
on his arm, and is permitted to draw blood, as
though in reward for its recent treatment.</p>
<p>
"Is any incredulous here? Shall I try it on
thee?"</p>

<a name="page158" id="page158"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;158]</span>
<p>
The individual addressed, a poverty-stricken
youth whose place was doubtless required for some
more promising customer behind, flees in terror, as
the gaping jaws approach him. One and another
having been similarly dismissed from points of vantage,
and a redistribution of front seats effected, the
incredulous are once more tauntingly addressed and
challenged. This time the challenge is accepted by
a foreigner, who hands in a chicken held by its
wings.</p>
<p>
"So? Blessed be God! Its doom is sealed if
it comes within reach of the snake. See here!"</p>
<p>
All eagerly press forward, many rising to their
feet, and it is difficult to see over their shoulders the
next gruesome act. The reptile, held by the neck
in the performer's right hand, is shown the chicken
in the other, and annoyed by having it poked in its
face, too frightened to perceive what is happening.
In a moment the fangs are shot out, and a wound
inflicted in the exposed part under the wing. Blood
appears, and the bird is thrown down, being held in
place by the performer's foot till in a few minutes
its struggles cease. Then, picking the victim up,
he holds it aloft by one wing to show its condition,
and exultingly calls for a Fátihah.</p>
<p>
It is enough: my patience is exhausted, and I
rise to make off with stiff knees, content at last with
what I have seen and heard of the "charming" of
snakes in Morocco.</p>

<h2>IN A MOORISH CAFÉ</h2>

<p class="center1">
"A little from a friend is much."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
To the passer-by, least of all to the European, there
is nothing in its external appearance to recommend
old Hashmi's <i>café</i>. From the street, indeed, it is
hardly visible, for it lies within the threshold of a
caravansarai or fandak, in which beasts are tethered,
goods accumulated and travellers housed, and of
which the general appearance is that of a neglected
farm-yard. Round an open court a colonnade supports
the balcony by which rooms on the upper
story are approached, a narrow staircase in the
corner leading right up to the terraced roof. In
the daytime the sole occupants of the rooms are
women whose partners for the time being have
securely locked them in before going to work.</p>
<p>
Beside the lofty archway forming the gate of
this strange hostelry, is Hashmi's stall, at which
green tea or a sweet, pea-soupy preparation of
coffee may be had at all hours of the day, but the
<i>café</i> proper, gloomy by daylight, lies through the
door behind. Here, of an evening, the candles lit,
his regular customers gather with tiny pipes, indulging
in flowing talk. Each has before him his
harmless glass, as he squats or reclines on the<a name="page160" id="page160"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;160]</span>
rush-matted floor. Nothing of importance occurs in
the city but is within a little made known here with
as much certainty as if the proprietor subscribed to an
evening paper. Any man who has something fresh
to tell, who can interest or amuse the company,
and by his frequent visits give the house a name, is
always welcome, and will find a glass awaiting him
whenever he chooses to come.</p>
<p>
Old Hashmi knows his business, and if the
evening that I was there may be taken as a sample,
he deserves success. That night he was in the
best of humours. His house was full and trade
brisk. Fattah, a negro, was keeping the house
merry, so in view of coming demands, he brewed
a fresh pot of real "Mekkan." The surroundings
were grimy, and outside the rain came down in
torrents: but that was a decided advantage, since
it not only drove men indoors, but helped to keep
them there. Mesaôd, the one-eyed, had finished
an elaborate tuning of his two-stringed banjo, his
ginbri&mdash;a home-made instrument&mdash;and was proceeding
to arrive at a convenient pitch of voice
for his song. With a strong nasal accent he commenced
reciting the loves of Si Marzak and his
fair Azîzah: how he addressed her in the fondest
of language, and how she replied by caresses.
When he came to the chorus they all chimed in,
for the most part to their own tune and time, as
they rocked to and fro, some clapping, some beating
their thighs, and all applauding at the end.</p>
<p>
The whole ballad would not bear translation&mdash;for
English ears,&mdash;and the scanty portion which
may be given has lost its rhythm and cadence by
the change, for Arabic is very soft and beautiful<a name="page161" id="page161"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;161]</span>
to those who understand it. The time has come
when Azîzah, having quarrelled with Si Marzak
in a fit of perhaps too well-founded jealousy,
desires to "make it up again," and thus addresses
her beloved&mdash;</p>

While the singing was proceeding Sáïd and
Drees had been indulging in a game of draughts,
and as it ceased their voices could be heard in
eager play. "Call thyself a Mallem (master).
There, thy father was bewitched by a hyena; there,
and there again!" shouted Sáïd, as he swept a
first, a second and a third of his opponent's pieces
from the board.</p>
<p>
But Drees was equal with him in another
move.</p>
<p>
"So, verily, thou art my master! Let us, then,
praise God for thy wisdom: thou art like indeed
unto him who verily shot the fox, but who killed
his own cow with the second shot! See, thus I
teach thee to boast before thy betters: ha, I laugh
at thee, I ride the donkey on thy head. I shave
that beard of thine!" he ejaculated, taking one
piece after another from his adversary, as the result
of an incautious move. The board had the appearance
of a well-kicked footstool, and the "men"&mdash;called
"dogs" in Barbary&mdash;were more like baseless
chess pawns. The play was as unlike that of
Europeans as possible; the moves from "room" to
"room" were of lightning swiftness, and accompanied
by a running fire of slang ejaculations,
chiefly sarcastic, but, on the whole, enlivened with
a vein of playful humour not to be Englished
politely. Just as the onlookers would become
interested in the progress of one or the other,<a name="page163" id="page163"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;163]</span>
a too rapid advance by either would result in an
incomprehensible wholesale clearing of the board
by his opponent's sleeve. Yet without a stop the
pieces would be replaced in order, and a new game
commenced, the vanquished too proud to acknowledge
that he did not quite see how the victor had
won.</p>
<p>
Then Fattah, whose <i>forte</i> was mimicry, attracted
the attention of the company by a representation
of a fat wazeer at prayers. Amid roars of laughter
he succeeded in rising to his feet with the help of
those beside him, who had still to lend occasional
support, as his knees threatened to give way under
his apparently ponderous carcase. Before and
behind, his shirt was well stuffed with cushions, and
the sides were not forgotten. His cheeks were
puffed out to the utmost, and his eyes rolled
superbly. At last the moment came for him to go
on his knees, when he had to be let gently down by
those near him, but his efforts to bow his head, now
top-heavy with a couple of shirts for a turban, were
most ludicrous, as he fell on one side in apparently
vain endeavours. The spectators roared with
laughter till the tears coursed down their cheeks;
but that black and solemn face remained unmoved,
and at the end of the prescribed motions the pseudo-great
man apparently fell into slumber as heavy as
himself, and snored in a style that a prize pig might
have envied.</p>
<p>
"Áfuk! Áfuk!" the deafening bravos resounded,
for Fattah had excelled himself, and was amply
rewarded by the collection which followed.</p>
<p>
A tale was next demanded from a jovial man of
Fez, who, nothing loth, began at once&mdash;</p>

<a name="page164" id="page164"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;164]</span>
<p>
"Evening was falling as across the plain of
Háhá trudged a weary traveller. The cold wind
whistled through his tattered garments. The path
grew dim before his eyes. The stars came out one
by one, but no star of hope shone for him. He
was faint and hungry. His feet were sore. His
head ached. He shivered.</p>
<p>
"'May God have pity on me!' he muttered.</p>
<p>
"God heard him. A few minutes later he
descried an earthly star&mdash;a solitary light was twinkling
on the distant hillside. Thitherward he turned
his steps.</p>
<p>
"Hope rose within him. His step grew brisk.
The way seemed clear. Onward he pushed.</p>
<p>
"Presently he could make out the huts of a
village.</p>
<p>
"'Thank God!' he cried; but still he had no
supper.</p>
<p>
"His empty stomach clamoured. His purse
was empty also. The fiendish dogs of the village
yelped at him. He paused discomfited. He
called.</p>
<p>
"Widow Záïdah stood before her light.</p>
<p>
"'Who's there?'</p>
<p>
"'A God-guest'</p>
<p>
"'In God's name, then, welcome! Silence
there, curs!'</p>
<p>
"Abd el Hakk approached.</p>
<p>
"'God bless thee, my mother, and repay thee a
thousand-fold!'</p>
<p>
"But Záïdah herself was poor. Her property
consisted only of a hut and some fowls. She set
before him eggs&mdash;two, hard-boiled,&mdash;bread also.
He thanked God. He ate.</p>
<p>
"'Yes, God will repay,' she said.</p>
<p>
"Next day Abd el Hakk passed on to Marrákesh.
There God blessed him. Years passed on;
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Abd el Hakk<a name="page165" id="page165"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;165]</span>
was rich. Melûdi the lawyer disliked him. Said
he to Widow Záïdah&mdash;</p>
<p>
"'Abd el Hakk, whom once thou succouredst,
is rich. The two eggs were never yet paid for.
Hadst thou not given them to him they would
have become two chickens. These would each
have laid hundreds. Those hundreds, when hatched,
would have laid their thousands. In seven years,
think to what amount Abd el Hakk is indebted to
thee. Sue him.'</p>
<p>
"Widow Záïdah listened. What is more, she
acted. Abd el Hakk failed to appear to rebut the
claim. He was worth no more.</p>
<p>
"'Why is the defendant not here?' asked the
judge.</p>
<p>
"'My lord,' said his attorney, 'he is gone to
sow boiled beans.'</p>
<p>
"'Boiled beans!'</p>
<p>
"'Boiled beans, my lord.'</p>
<p>
"'Is he mad?'</p>
<p>
"'He is very wise, my lord.'</p>
<p>
"'Thou mockest.'</p>
<p>
"'My lord, if boiled eggs can be hatched, sure
boiled beans will grow!'</p>
<p>
"'Dismissed with costs!'</p>
<p>
"The tree that bends with every wind that
blows will seldom stand upright."</p>

     <br /><hr class="short" /><br />
<p>
A round of applause greeted the clever tale, of
which the speaker's gestures had told even more
than his words. But the merriment of the company
only began there, for forthwith a babel of
tongues was occupied in the discussion of all the
points of the case, in imagining every impossible or
humorous alternative, and laughter resounded on
every side, as the glasses were quickly refilled with
an innocent drink.</p>

<h3>XX</h3>

<h2>THE MEDICINE-MAN</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Wine is a key to all evil."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Under the glare of an African sun, its rays, however,
tempered by a fresh Atlantic breeze; no roof
to his consulting-room save the sky, no walls surrounding
him to keep off idle starers like ourselves;
by the roadside sits a native doctor of repute. His
costume is that of half the crowd around, outwardly
consisting of a well-worn brown woollen cloak with
a hood pulled over his head, from beneath the skirts
of which protrude his muddy feet. By his side lies
the basket containing his supplies and less delicate
instruments; the finer ones we see him draw from
a capacious wallet of leather beneath his cloak.</p>
<p>
Though personally somewhat gaunt, he is nevertheless
a jolly-looking character, totally free from
that would-be professional air assumed by some of
our medical students to hide lack of experience; for
he, empiric though he be, has no idea of any of his
own shortcomings, and greets us with an easy smile.
He is seated on the ground, hugging his knees till
his attention is drawn to us, when, observing our gaze
at his lancets on the ground, he picks one up to
show it. Both are of rude construction, merely
pieces of flat steel filed to double-edged points, and<a name="page167" id="page167"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;167]</span>
protected by two flaps slightly bigger, in the one case
of bone, in the other of brass. A loose rivet holding
all together at one end completes the instrument.
The brass one he says was made by a Jew in Fez
out of an old clock; the other by a Jew in Marrákesh.
For the purpose of making scratches for
cupping he has a piece of flat steel about half an
inch wide, sharpened across the end chisel-fashion.
Then he has a piece of an old razor-blade tied to
a stick with a string. That this is sharp he soon
demonstrates by skilfully shaving an old man's head,
after only damping the eighth of an inch stub with
which it is covered. A stone and a bit of leather,
supplemented by the calves of his legs, or his biceps,
serve to keep the edges in condition.</p>
<p>
From a finger-shaped leather bag in his satchel
he produces an antiquated pair of tooth extractors,
a small pair of forceps for pulling out thorns,
and a stiletto. The first-named article, he informs
us, came from France to Tafilált, his home, <i>viâ</i>
Tlemçen; it is of the design known as "Fox's
claw," and he explains to us that the difference
between the French and the English article is that
the one has no spring to keep the jaws open, while
the other has. A far more formidable instrument
is the genuine native contrivance, a sort of exaggerated
corkscrew without a point.</p>
<p>
But here comes a patient to be treated. He
troubles the doctor with no diagnosis, asking only
to be bled. He is a youth of medium height, bronzed
by the sun. Telling him to sit down and bare his
right arm, the operator feels it well up and down,
and then places the tips of the patient's fingers on
the ground, bidding him not to move. Pouring out<a name="page168" id="page168"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;168]</span>
a little water into a metal dish, he washes the arm
on the inside of the elbow, drying it with his cloak.
Next he ties a piece of list round the upper arm as
tightly as he can, and selecting one of the lancets,
makes an incision into the vein which the washing
has rendered visible. A bright stream issues, squirting
into the air some fifteen inches; it is soon, however,
directed into a tin soup-plate holding fourteen
ounces, as we ascertained by measurement. The
operator washes and dries his lancet, wraps the two
in a white rag, and puts them into a piece of cane
which forms an excellent case. Meanwhile the plate
has filled, and he turns his attention once more to
the patient. One or two passers-by have stopped,
like ourselves, to look on.</p>
<p>
"I knew a man," says one, "who was being bled
like that, and kept on saying, 'take a little more,'
till he fell back dead in our arms."</p>
<p>
"Yes," chimes in another, "I have heard of such
cases; it is very dangerous."</p>
<p>
Although the patient is evidently growing very
nervous, our surgical friend affects supreme indifference
to all this tittle-tattle, and after a while
removes the bandage, bending the forearm inward,
with the effect of somewhat checking the flow of
blood. When he has bound up with list the cane
that holds the lancets, he closes the forearm back
entirely, so that the flow is stopped. Opening it
again a little, he wipes a sponge over the aperture
a few times, and closes it with his thumb. Then he
binds a bit of filthy rag round the arm, twisting it
above and below the elbow alternately, and crossing
over the incision each time. When this is done, he
sends the patient to throw away the blood and wash<a name="page169" id="page169"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;169]</span>
the plate, receiving for the whole operation the sum
of three half-pence.</p>
<p>
Another patient is waiting his turn, an old man
desiring to be bled behind the ears for headache.
After shaving two patches for the purpose, the
"bleeder," as he is justly called, makes eighteen
scratches close together, about half an inch long.
Over these he places a brass cup of the shape of
a high Italian hat without the brim. From near
the edge of this protrudes a long brass tube with
a piece of leather round and over the end. This
the operator sucks to create a vacuum, the moistened
leather closing like a valve, which leaves the cup
hanging <i>in situ</i>. Repeating this on the other side,
he empties the first cup of the blood which has by
this time accumulated in it, and so on alternately,
till he has drawn off what appears to him to be
sufficient. All that remains to be done is to wipe
the wounds and receive the fee.</p>
<p>
Some years ago such a worthy as this earned
quite a reputation for exorcising devils in Southern
Morocco. His mode of procedure was brief, but
as a rule effective. The patient was laid on the
ground before the wise man's tent, face downward,
and after reading certain mystic and unintelligible
passages, selected from one of the ponderous tomes
which form a prominent part of the "doctor's"
stock-in-trade, he solemnly ordered two or three
men to hold the sufferer down while two more
thrashed him till they were tired. If, when released,
the patient showed the least sign of returning
violence, or complained that the whole affair was
a fraud, it was taken as a sure sign that he had
not had enough, and he was forthwith seized again<a name="page170" id="page170"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;170]</span>
and the dose repeated till he had learned that discretion
was the better part of valour, and slunk off,
perhaps a wiser, certainly a sadder man. It is said,
and I do not doubt it&mdash;though it is more than most
medical men can say of their patients&mdash;that no one
was ever known to return in quest of further treatment.</p>
<p>
All this, however, is nothing compared with the
Moor's love of fire as a universal panacea. Not
only for his mules and his horses, but also for himself
and his family, cauterization is in high repute,
especially as he estimates the value of a remedy as
much by its immediate and visible action as by its
ultimate effects. The "fire-doctor" is therefore even
a greater character in his way than the "bleeder,"
whom we have just visited. His outfit includes a
collection of queer-shaped irons designed to cauterize
different parts of the body, a portable brazier, and
bellows made from a goat-skin with a piece of board
at one side wherewith to press and expel the air
through a tube on the other side. He, too, sits by
the roadside, and disposes of his groaning though
wonderfully enduring "patients" much as did his
rival of the lancet. Rohlfs, a German doctor
who explored parts of Morocco in the garb of a
native, exercising what he could of his profession
for a livelihood, tells how he earned a considerable
reputation by the introduction of "cold fire" (lunar
caustic) as a rival to the original style; and Pellow,
an English slave who made his escape in 1735,
found cayenne pepper of great assistance in ingratiating
himself with the Moors in this way, and even
in delaying a pursuer suffering from ophthalmia
by blowing a little into his eyes before his identity<a name="page171" id="page171"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;171]</span>
was discovered. In extenuation of this trick,
however, it must be borne in mind that cayenne
pepper is an accredited Moorish remedy for ophthalmia,
being placed on the eyelids, though it is
only a mixture of canary seed and sugar that is
blown in.</p>
<p>
Every European traveller in Morocco is supposed
to know something about medicine, and many have
been my own amusing experiences in this direction.
Nothing that I used gave me greater fame than a
bottle of oil of cantharides, the contents of which I
applied freely behind the ears or upon the temples
of such victims of ophthalmia as submitted themselves
to my tender mercies. Only I found that
when my first patient began to dance with the joy
and pain of the noble blister which shortly arose,
so many people fancied they needed like treatment
that I was obliged to restrict the use of so popular
a cure to special cases.</p>
<p>
One branch of Moroccan medicine consists in
exorcising devils, of which a most amusing instance
once came under my notice. An English gentleman
gave one of his servants who complained
of being troubled with these unwelcome guests two
good-sized doses of tartaric acid and carbonate of
soda a second apart. The immediate exit of the
devil was so apparent that the fame of the prescriber
as a medical man was made at once. But many of
the cases which the amateur is called upon to treat
are much more difficult to satisfy than this. Superstition
is so strongly mingled with the native ideas
of disease,&mdash;of being possessed,&mdash;that the two can
hardly be separated. During an epidemic of cholera,
for instance, the people keep as close as possible to<a name="page172" id="page172"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;172]</span>
walls, and avoid sand-hills, for fear of "catching
devils." All disease is indeed more or less ascribed
to satanic agency, and in Morocco that practitioner
is most in repute who claims to attack this cause of
the malady rather than its effect.</p>
<p>
Although the Moors have a certain rudimentary
acquaintance with simple medicinal agents&mdash;and
how rudimentary that acquaintance is, will better
appear from what is to follow,&mdash;in all their pharmacop&oelig;ia
no remedy is so often recommended or so
implicitly relied on as the "writing" of a man of
reputed sanctity. Such a writing may consist merely
of a piece of paper scribbled over with the name of
God, or with some sentence from the Korán, such
as, "And only God is the Healer," repeated many
times, or in special cases it may contain a whole
series of pious expressions and meaningless incantations.
For an ordinary external complaint, such
as general debility arising from the evil eye of a
neighbour or a jealous wife, or as a preventative
against bewitchment, or as a love philtre, it is
usually considered sufficient to wear this in a leather
bag around the neck or forehead; but in case of
unfathomable internal disease, such as indigestion,
the "writing" is prescribed to be divided into so
many equal portions, and taken in a little water
night and morning.</p>
<p>
The author of these potent documents is sometimes
a hereditary saint descended from Mohammed,
sometimes a saint whose sanctity arises from
real or assumed insanity&mdash;for to be mad in Barbary
is to have one's thoughts so occupied with things of
heaven as to have no time left for things of earth,&mdash;and
often they are written by ordinary public<a name="page173" id="page173"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;173]</span>
scribes, or schoolmasters, for among the Moors
reading and religion are almost synonymous terms.
There are, however, a few professional gentlemen
who dispense these writings among their drugs.
Such alone of all their quacks aspire to the title of
"doctor." Most of these spend their time wandering
about the country from fair to fair, setting up
their tents wherever there are patients to be found
in sufficient numbers.</p>
<p>
Attired as natives, let us visit one. Arrived at
the tent door, we salute the learned occupant with
the prescribed "Salám oo alaïkum" ("To you be
peace"), to which, on noting our superior costumes,
he replies with a volley of complimentary inquiries
and welcomes. These we acknowledge with dignity,
and with as sedate an air as possible. We leisurely
seat ourselves on the ground in orthodox style, like
tailors. As it would not be good form to mention
our business at once, we defer professional consultation
till we have inquired successfully after his
health, his travels, and the latest news at home and
from abroad. In the course of conversation he gives
us to understand that he is one of the Sultan's uncles,
which is by no means impossible in a country where
it has not been an unknown thing for an imperial
father to lose count of his numerous progeny.</p>
<p>
Feeling at last that we have broken the ice, we
turn the conversation to the subject of our supposed
ailments. My own complaint is a general internal
disorder resulting in occasional feverishness, griping
pains, and loss of sleep. After asking a number
of really sensible questions, such as would seem to
place him above the ordinary rank of native practitioners,
he gravely announces that he has "the<a name="page174" id="page174"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;174]</span>
very thing" in the form of a powder, which, from its
high virtues, and the exceeding number of its ingredients,
some of them costly, is rather expensive.
We remember the deference with which our costumes
were noted, and understand. But, after all,
the price of a supply is announced to be only seven-pence
halfpenny. The contents of some of the
canisters he shows us include respectively, according
to his account, from twenty to fifty drugs. For our
own part, we strongly suspect that all are spices to
be procured from any Moorish grocer.</p>
<p>
Together with the prescription I receive instructions
to drink the soup from a fat chicken in
the morning, and to eat its flesh in the evening; to
eat hot bread and drink sweet tea, and to do as
little work as possible, the powder to be taken daily
for a fortnight in a little honey. Whatever else he
may not know, it is evident that our doctor knows
full well how to humour his patients.</p>
<p>
The next case is even more easy of treatment
than mine, a "writing" only being required. On a
piece of very common paper two or three inches
square, the doctor writes something of which the
only legible part is the first line: "In the name of
God, the Pitying, the Pitiful," followed, we subsequently
learn, by repetitions of "Only God is the
Healer." For this the patient is to get his wife to
make a felt bag sewed with coloured silk, into which
the charm is to be put, along with a little salt and a
few parings of garlic, after which it is to be worn
round his neck for ever.</p>
<p>
Sometimes, in wandering through Morocco, one
comes across much more curious remedies than
these, for the worthy we have just visited is but a<a name="page175" id="page175"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;175]</span>
commonplace type in this country. A medical
friend once met a professional brother in the interior
who had a truly original method of proving his skill.
By pressing his finger on the side of his nose close
to his eye, he could send a jet of liquid right into his
interlocutor's face, a proceeding sufficient to satisfy
all doubts as to his alleged marvellous powers. On
examination it was found that he had a small orifice
near the corner of the eye, through which the
pressure forced the lachrymal fluid, pure tears, in
fact. This is just an instance of the way in which
any natural defect or peculiarity is made the most
of by these wandering empirics, to impose on their
ignorant and credulous victims.</p>
<p>
Even such of them as do give any variety of
remedies are hardly more to be trusted. Whatever
they give, their patients like big doses, and are
not content without corresponding visible effects.
Epsom salts, which are in great repute, are never
given to a man in less quantities than two tablespoonfuls.
On one occasion a poor woman came to
me suffering from ague, and looking very dejected.
I mixed this quantity of salts in a tumblerful of
water, with a good dose of quinine, bidding her
drink two-thirds of it, and give the remainder to
her daughter, who evidently needed it as much as
she did. Her share was soon disposed of with
hardly more than a grimace, to the infinite enjoyment
of a fat, black slave-girl who was standing by,
and who knew from personal experience what a
tumblerful meant. But to induce the child to take
hers was quite another matter. "What! not drink
it?" the mother cried, as she held the potion to her
lips. "The devil take thee, thou cursed offspring of<a name="page176" id="page176"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;176]</span>
an abandoned woman! May God burn thy ancestors!"
But though the child, accustomed to such
mild and motherly invectives, budged not, it had
proved altogether too much for the jovial slave,
who was by this time convulsed with laughter, and
so, I may as well confess, was I. At last the
woman's powers of persuasion were exhausted, and
she drained the glass herself.</p>
<p>
When in Fez some years ago, a dog I had with
me needed dosing, so I got three drops of croton
oil on sugar made ready for him. Mine host, a
man of fifty or more, came in meanwhile, and
having ascertained the action of the drug from my
servant, thought it might possibly do him good, and
forthwith swallowed it. Of this the first intimation
I had was from the agonizing screams of the old
man, who loudly proclaimed that his last hour was
come, and from the terrified wails of the females of
his household, who thought so too. When I saw
him he was rolling on the tiles of the courtyard, his
heels in the air, bellowing frantically. I need
hardly dilate upon the relief I felt when at last we
succeeded in alleviating his pain, and knew that he
was out of danger.</p>
<p>
Among the favourite remedies of Morocco,
hyena's head powder ranks high as a purge, and
the dried bones and flesh may often be seen in the
native spice-shops, coated with dust as they hang.
Some of the prescriptions given are too filthy to
repeat, almost to be believed. As a specimen, by no
means the worst, I may mention a recipe at one
time in favour among the Jewesses of Mogador,
according to one writer. This was to drink seven
draughts from the town drain where it entered the<a name="page177" id="page177"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;177]</span>
sea, beaten up with seven eggs. For diseases of
the "heart," by which they mean the stomach and
liver, and of eyes, joints, etc., a stone, which is found
in an animal called the horreh, the size of a small
walnut, and valued as high as twelve dollars, is ground
up and swallowed, the patient thereafter remaining
indoors a week. Ants, prepared in various ways, are
recommended for lethargy, and lion's flesh for
cowardice. Privet or mallow leaves, fresh honey,
and chameleons split open alive, are considered good
for wounds and sores, while the fumes from the
burning of the dried body of this animal are often
inhaled. Among more ordinary remedies are saraparilla,
senna, and a number of other well-known
herbs and roots, whose action is more or less understood.
Roasted pomegranate rind in powder is
found really effectual in dysentery and diarrh&oelig;a.</p>
<p>
Men and women continually apply for philtres,
and women for means to prevent their husbands
from liking rival wives, or for poison to put them
out of the way. As arsenic, corrosive sublimate,
and other poisons are sold freely to children in
every spice-shop, the number of unaccounted-for
deaths is extremely large, but inquiry is seldom
or never made. When it is openly averred that So-and-so
died from "a cup of tea," the only mental
comment seems to be that she was very foolish
not to be more careful what she drank, and to see
that whoever prepared it took the first sip according
to custom. The highest recommendation of any
particular dish or spice is that it is "heating."
Great faith is also placed in certain sacred rocks,
tree-stumps, etc., which are visited in the hope of
obtaining relief from all sorts of ailments. Visitors
<a name="page178" id="page178"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;178]</span>
often leave rags torn from their garments by which to
be remembered by the guardian of the place. Others
repair to the famous sulphur springs of Zarhôn,
supposed to derive their benefit from the interment
close by of a certain St. Jacob&mdash;and dance in
the waters, yelling without intermission, "Cold and
hot, O my lord Yakoob! Cold and hot!" fearful
lest any cessation of the cry might permit the
temperature to be increased or diminished beyond
the bearable point.</p>

<h2>THE HUMAN MART</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Who digs a pit for his brother will fall into it."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
The slave-market differs in no respect from any
other in Morocco, save in the nature of the "goods"
exposed. In most cases the same place is used for
other things at other times, and the same auctioneers
are employed to sell cattle. The buyers seat themselves
round an open courtyard, in the closed pens
of which are the slaves for sale. These are brought
out singly or in lots, inspected precisely as cattle
would be, and expatiated upon in much the same
manner.</p>
<p>
For instance, here comes a middle-aged man,
led slowly round by the salesman, who is describing
his "points" and noting bids. He has first-class
muscles, although he is somewhat thin. He is
made to lift a weight to prove his strength. His
thighs are patted, and his lips are turned to show
the gums, which at merrier moments would have
been visible without such a performance. With a
shame-faced, hang-dog air he trudges round, wondering
what will be his lot, though a sad one it is
already. At last he is knocked down for so many
score of dollars, and after a good deal of further
bargaining he changes hands.</p>

<a name="page180" id="page180"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;180]</span>
<p>
The next brought forward are three little girls&mdash;a
"job lot," maybe ten, thirteen, and sixteen years
of age&mdash;two of them evidently sisters. They are
declared to be already proficient in Arabic, and
ready for anything. Their muscles are felt, their
mouths examined, and their bodies scrutinized in
general, while the little one begins to cry, and the
others look as though they would like to keep her
company. Round and round again they are marched,
but the bids do not rise high enough to effect a sale,
and they are locked up again for a future occasion.
It is indeed a sad, sad sight.</p>
<p>
The sources of supply for the slave-market are
various, but the chief is direct from Guinea and the
Sáhara, where the raids of the traders are too well
understood to need description. Usually some
inter-tribal jealousy is fostered and fanned into a
flame, and the one which loses is plundered of
men and goods. Able-bodied lads and young girls
are in most demand, and fetch high prices when
brought to the north. The unfortunate prisoners
are marched with great hardship and privation to
depôts over the Atlas, where they pick up Arabic
and are initiated into Mohammedanism. To a
missionary who once asked one of the dealers how
they found their way across the desert, the terribly
significant reply was, "There are many bones along
the way!" After a while the survivors are either
exposed for sale in the markets of Marrákesh or Fez,
or hawked round from door to door in the coast towns,
where public auctions are prohibited. Some have
even found their way to Egypt and Constantinople,
having been transported in British vessels, and landed
at Gibraltar as members of the dealer's family!</p>

<a name="page181" id="page181"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;181]</span>
<p>
Another source of supply is the constant series
of quarrels between the tribes of Morocco itself,
during which many children are carried off who are
white or nearly so. In this case the victims are
almost all girls, for whom good prices are to be
obtained. This opens a door for illegal supplies,
children born of slaves and others kidnapped being
thus disposed of for hareems. For this purpose
the demand for white girls is much in excess of
that for black, so that great temptation is offered.
I knew a man who had seventeen such in his house,
and of nearly a dozen whom I saw there, none were
too dark to have passed for English brunettes.</p>
<p>
Though nothing whatever can be said in defence
of this practice of tearing our fellow-men from their
homes, and selling them as slaves, our natural feelings
of horror abate considerably when we become
acquainted with its results under the rule of Islám.
Instead of the fearful state of things which occurred
under English or American rule, it is a pleasure
to find that, whatever may be the shortcomings of
the Moors, in this case, at any rate, they have set
us a good example. Even their barbarous treatment
of Christian slaves till within a century was
certainly no worse than our treatment of black slaves.</p>
<p>
To begin with, Mohammedans make no distinction
in civil or religious rights between a black skin
and a white. So long as a man avows belief in no
god but God, and in Mohammed as the prophet of
God, complying with certain outward forms of his
religion, he is held to be as good a Muslim as anyone
else; and as the whole social and civil fabrics
are built upon religion and the teachings of the
Korán, the social position of every well-behaved<a name="page182" id="page182"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;182]</span>
Mohammedan is practically equal. The possession
of authority of any kind will naturally command a
certain amount of respectful attention, and he who
has any reason for seeking a favour from another is
sure to adopt a more subservient mien; but beyond
this, few such class distinctions are known as those
common in Europe. The slave who, away from
home, can behave as a gentleman, will be received
as such, irrespective of his colour, and when freed
he may aspire to any position under the Sultan.
There are, indeed, many instances of black men
having been ministers, governors, and even ambassadors
to Europe, and such appointments are too
common to excite astonishment. They have even,
in the past, assisted in giving rise to the misconception
that the people of Morocco were "Black-a-Moors."</p>
<p>
In many households the slave becomes the trusted
steward of his owner, and receives a sufficient allowance
to live in comfort. He will possess a paper
giving him his freedom on his master's death, and
altogether he will have a very good time of it. The
liberation of slaves is enjoined upon those who
follow Mohammed as a most praiseworthy act, and
as one which cannot fail to bring its own reward.
But, like too many in our own land, they more often
prefer to make use of what they possess till they
start on that journey on which they can take nothing
with them, and then affect generosity by bestowing
upon others that over which they lose control.</p>
<p>
One poor fellow whom I knew very well, who
had been liberated on the death of his master,
having lost his papers, was re-kidnapped and sold
again to a man who was subsequently imprisoned for<a name="page183" id="page183"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;183]</span>
fraud, when he got free and worked for some years
as porter; but he was eventually denounced and
put in irons in a dungeon as part of the property
of his <i>soi-disant</i> master.</p>
<p>
The ordinary place of the slave is much that
of the average servant, but receiving only board,
lodging, and scanty clothing, without pay, and being
unable to change masters. Sometimes, however,
they are permitted to beg or work for money to
buy their own freedom, when they become, as it
were, their own masters. On the whole, a jollier,
harder-working, or better-tempered lot than these
Negroes it would be hard to desire, and they are as
light-hearted, fortunately, as true-hearted, even in
the midst of cruel adversities.</p>
<p>
The condition of a woman slave&mdash;to which, also,
most of what has been said refers&mdash;is as much
behind that of a man-slave as is that of a free-woman
behind that of her lord. If she becomes
her master's wife, the mother of a child, she is
thereby freed, though she must remain in his service
until his death, and she is only treated as an animal,
not as a human being.</p>
<p>
After all, there is a dark side&mdash;one sufficiently
dark to need no intensifying. The fact of one man
being the possessor of another, just as much as he
could be of a horse or cow, places him in the same
position with regard to his "chattel" as to such a
four-footed animal. "The merciful man is merciful
to his beast," but "the tender mercies of the
wicked are cruel," and just as one man will ill-treat
his beast, while another treats his well, so will one
man persecute his slave. Instances of this are
quite common enough, and here and there cases
<a name="page184" id="page184"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;184]</span>
could be brought forward of revolting brutality, as
in the story which follows, but the great thing is
that agricultural slavery is practically unknown, and
that what exists is chiefly domestic. "Know the
slave," says an Arab proverb, "and you know the
master."</p>

<h2>A SLAVE-GIRL'S STORY</h2>

<p class="center1">
"After many adversities, joy."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Outside the walls of Mazagan an English traveller
had pitched his camp. Night had fallen when one
of his men, returning from the town, besought admission
to the tent.</p>
<p>
"Well, how now?"</p>
<p>
"Sir, I have a woman here, by thy leave, yes,
a woman, a slave, whom I found at the door of
thy consulate, where she had taken refuge, but the
police guard drove her away, so I brought her to
thee for justice. Have pity on her, and God will
reward thee! See, here! Rabhah!" </p>
<p>
At this bidding there approached a truly pitiable
object, a dark-skinned woman, not quite black,
though of decidedly negroid appearance&mdash;whose
tattered garments scarcely served to hide a half-starved
form. Throwing herself on the ground
before the foreigner, she begged his pity, his
assistance, for the sake of the Pitiful God.</p>
<p>
"Oh, Bashador," she pleaded, addressing him
as though a foreign envoy, "I take refuge with
God and with thee! I have no one else. I have
fled from my master, who has cruelly used me. See
my back!"</p>

<a name="page186" id="page186"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;186]</span>
<p>
Suiting action to word, she slipped aside the
coverings from her shoulder and revealed the weals
of many a stripe, tears streaming down her face the
while. Her tones were such as none but a heart of
stone could ignore.</p>
<p>
"I bore it ten days, sir, till I could do so no
longer, and then I escaped. It was all to make me
give false witness&mdash;from which God deliver me&mdash;for
that I will never do. My present master is the
Sheïkh bin Záharah, Lieutenant Kaïd of the Boo
Azeezi, but I was once the slave-wife of the English
agent, who sold me again, though they said that he
dare not, because of his English protection. That
was why I fled for justice to the English consul,
and now come to thee. For God's sake, succour
me!"</p>
<p>
With a sob her head fell forward on her breast,
as again she crouched at the foreigner's feet, till
made to rise and told to relate her whole story
quietly. When she was calmer, aided by questions,
she unfolded a tale which could, alas! be often
paralleled in Morocco.</p>
<p>
"My home? How can I tell thee where that
was, when I was brought away so early? All I
know is that it was in the Sûdán" (<i>i.e.</i> Land of
the Blacks), "and that I came to Mogador on my
mother's back. In my country the slave-dealers
lie in wait outside the villages to catch the children
when they play. They put them in bags like those
used for grain, with their heads left outside the necks
for air. So they are carried off, and travel all the
way to this country slung on mules, being set down
from time to time to be fed. But I, though born free,
was brought by my mother, who had been carried<a name="page187" id="page187"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;187]</span>
off as a slave. The lines cut on my cheek show that,
for every free-born child in our country is marked
so by its mother. That is our sultan's order.
In Mogador my mother's master sold me to a man
who took me from her, and brought me to Dár el
Baïda. They took away my mother first; they
dragged her off crying, and I never saw or heard
of her again. When she was gone I cried for her,
and could not eat till they gave me sugar and sweet
dates. At Dár el Baïda I was sold in the market
auction to a shareefa named Lálla Moïna, wife of
the mountain scribe who taught the kádi's children.
With her I was very happy, for she treated me
well, and when she went to Mekka on the pilgrimage
she let me go out to work on my own account,
promising to make me free if God brought her
back safely. She was good to me, Bashador, but
though she returned safely she always put off making
me free; but I had laid by fifteen dollars, and had
bought a boxful of clothes as well. And that was
where my trouble began. For God's sake succour
me!</p>
<p>
"One day the agent saw me in the street, and
eyed me so that I was frightened of him. He
followed me home, and then sent a letter offering to
buy me, but my mistress refused. Then the agent
often came to the house, and I had to wait upon
him. He told me that he wanted to buy me, and
that if he did I should be better off than if I were
free, but I refused to listen. When the agent was
away his man Sarghîni used to come and try to
buy me, but in vain; and when the agent returned
he threatened to bring my mistress into trouble if
she refused. At last she had to yield, and I cried<a name="page188" id="page188"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;188]</span>
when I had to go. 'Thou art sold to that man,'
she said; 'but as thou art a daughter to me, he
has promised to take care of thee and bring thee
back whenever I wish.'</p>
<p>
"Sarghîni took me out by one gate with the
servants of the agent, who took care to go out with
a big fat Jew by another, that the English consul
should not see him go out with a woman. We
rode on mules, and I wore a white cloak; I had not
then begun to fast" (<i>i.e.</i> was not yet twelve years
of age). "After two days on the road the agent
asked for the key of my box, in which he found my
fifteen dollars, tied up in a rag, and took them, but
gave me back my clothes. We were five days
travelling to Marrákesh, staying each night with
a kaïd who treated us very well. So I came to
the agent's house.</p>
<p>
"There I found many other slave girls, besides
men slaves in the garden. These were Ruby,
bought in Saffi, by whom the agent had a daughter;
and Star, a white girl stolen from her home in Sûs,
who had no children; Jessamine the Less, another
white girl bought in Marrákesh, mother of one
daughter; Jessamine the Greater, whose daughter
was her father's favourite, loaded with jewels; and
others who cooked or served, not having children,
though one had a son who died. There were
thirteen of us under an older slave who clothed and
fed us.</p>
<p>
"When the bashador came to the house the agent
shut all but five or six of us in a room, the others
waiting on him. I used to have to cook for the
bashador, for whom they had great receptions with
music and dancing-women. Next door there was a
<a name="page189" id="page189"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;189]</span>
larger house, a fandak, where the agent kept public
women and boys, and men at the door took money
from the Muslims and Nazarenes who went there.
The missionaries who lived close by know the truth
of what I say.</p>
<p>
"A few days after I arrived I was bathed and
dressed in fresh clothes, and taken to my master's
room, as he used to call for one or another according
to fancy. But I had no child, because he struck
me, and I was sick. When one girl, named Amber,
refused to go to him because she was ill, he dragged
her off to another part of the house. Presently we
heard the report of a pistol, and he came back to
say she was dead. He had a pistol in his hand as
long as my forearm. We found the girl in a pool
of blood in agonies, and tried to flee, but had nowhere
to go. So when she was quite dead he made
us wash her. Then he brought in four men to dig
a pit, in which he said he would bury butter. When
they had gone we buried her there, and I can show
you the spot.</p>
<p>
"One day he took two men slaves and me on a
journey. One of them ran away, the other was sold
by the way. I was sold at the Tuesday market of
Sîdi bin Nûr to a dealer in slaves, whom I heard
promise my master to keep me close for three
months, and not to sell me in that place lest the
Nazarenes should get word of it. Some time after
I was bought by a tax-collector, with whom I remained
till he died, and then lived in the house of
his son. This man sold me to my present master,
who has ill-treated me as I told thee. Oh, Bashador,
when I fled from him, I came to the English consul
because I was told that the agent had had no right<a name="page190" id="page190"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;190]</span>
to hold or sell me, since he had English protection.
Thou knowest what has happened since. Here I
am, at thy feet, imploring assistance. I beseech
thee, turn me not away. I speak truth before
God."</p>
<p>
No one could hear such a tale unmoved, and
after due inquiry the Englishman thus appealed to
secured her liberty on depositing at the British
Consulate the $140 paid for her by her owner, who
claimed her or the money. Rabhah's story, taken
down by independent persons at different times,
was afterwards told by her without variation in a
British Court of Law. Subsequently a pronouncement
as to her freedom having been made by the
British Legation at Tangier, the $140 was refunded,
and she lives free to-day. The last time the writer
saw her, in the service of a European in Morocco,
he was somewhat taken aback to find her arms
about his neck, and to have kisses showered on his
shoulders for the unimportant part that he had
played in securing her freedom.</p>

<h2>THE PILGRIM CAMP</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Work for the children is better than pilgrimage or holy war."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Year by year the month succeeding the fast of
Ramadán sees a motley assemblage of pilgrims
bound for Mekka, gathered at most of the North
African ports from all parts of Barbary and even
beyond, awaiting vessels bound for Alexandria or
Jedda. This comparatively easy means of covering
the distance, which includes the whole length of the
Mediterranean when the pilgrims from Morocco
are concerned&mdash;not to mention some two-thirds of
the Red Sea,&mdash;has almost entirely superseded the
original method of travelling all the way by land, in
the once imposing caravans.</p>
<p>
These historic institutions owed their importance
no less to the facilities they offered for trade, than to
the opportunity they afforded for accomplishing the
pilgrimage which is enjoined on every follower of
Mohammed. Although caravans still cross the
deserts of North Africa in considerable force from
west to east, as well as from south to north, to carry
on the trade of the countries to the south of the
Barbary States, the former are steadily dwindling
down to mere local affairs, and the number of
travellers who select the modern route by steamer<a name="page192" id="page192"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;192]</span>
is yearly increasing, as its advantages become better
known. For the accommodation of the large
number of passengers special vessels are chartered
by speculators, and are fitted up for the occasion.
Only some £3 are charged for the whole journey
from Tangier, a thousand pilgrims being crowded
on a medium-sized merchant vessel, making the
horrors of the voyage indescribable.</p>
<p>
But the troubles of the pilgrims do not begin
here. Before they could even reach the sea some
of them will have travelled on foot for a month
from remote parts of the interior, and at the coast
they may have to endure a wearisome time of waiting
for a steamer. It is while they are thus learning
a lesson of patience at one of the Moorish ports
that I will invite you for a stroll round their encampment
on the market-place.</p>
<p>
This consists of scores of low, makeshift tents,
with here and there a better-class round one dotted
amongst them. The prevailing shape of the
majority is a modified edition of the dwelling of
the nomad Arab, to which class doubtless belongs
a fair proportion of their occupants. Across the
top of two poles about five feet high, before and
behind, a ridge-piece is placed, and over this is
stretched to the ground on either side a long piece
of palmetto or goat-hair cloth, or perhaps one of
the long woollen blankets worn by men and women
alike, called haïks, which will again be used for its
original purpose on board the vessel. The back is
formed of another piece of some sort of cloth
stretched out at the bottom to form a semi-circle,
and so give more room inside. Those who have a
bit of rug or a light mattress, spread it on the floor,<a name="page193" id="page193"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;193]</span>
and pile their various other belongings around its
edge.</p>
<p>
The straits to which many of these poor people
are put to get a covering of any kind to shelter
them from sun, rain, and wind, are often very
severe, to judge from some of the specimens of
tents&mdash;if they deserve the name&mdash;constructed of
all sorts of odds and ends, almost anything, it
would seem, that will cover a few square inches.
There is one such to be seen on this busy market
which deserves special attention as a remarkable
example of this style of architecture. Let us examine
it. The materials of which it is composed
include hair-cloth, woollen-cloth, a cotton shirt, a
woollen cloak, and some sacking; goat skin, sheep's
fleece, straw, and palmetto cord; rush mats, a palmetto
mat, split-cane baskets and wicker baskets;
bits of wood, a piece of cork, bark and sticks;
petroleum tins flattened out, sheet iron, zinc, and
jam and other tins; an earthenware dish and a
stone bottle, with bits of crockery, stones, and a
cow's horn to weight some of the other items down.
Now, if any one can make anything of this, which
is an exact inventory of such of the materials as are
visible on the outside, he must be a born architect.
Yet here this extraordinary construction
stands, as it has stood for several months, and its
occupant looks the jolliest fellow out. Let us pay
him a visit.</p>
<p>
Stooping down to look under the flap which
serves as a door, and raising it with my stick, I
greet him with the customary salutation of "Peace
be with you." "With you be peace," is the cheery
reply, to which is added, "Welcome to thee; make<a name="page194" id="page194"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;194]</span>
thyself at home." Although invited to enter, I feel
quite enough at home on the outside of his dwelling,
so reply that I have no time to stay, as I only
"looked in" to have the pleasure of making his
acquaintance and examining his "palace." At the
last word one or two bystanders who have gathered
round indulge in a little chuckle to themselves,
overhearing which I turn round and make the most
flattering remarks I can think of as to its beauty,
elegance, comfort, and admirable system of ventilation,
which sets the whole company, tenant included,
into a roar of laughter. Mine host is busy
cleaning fish, and now presses us to stay and share
his evening meal with him, but our appetites are
not quite equal to <i>that</i> yet, though it is beyond
doubt that the morsel he would offer us would be
as savoury and well cooked as could be supplied
by any restaurant in Piccadilly.</p>
<p>
Inquiries elicit the fact that our friend is hoping
to leave for Mekka by the first steamer, and that
meanwhile he supports himself as a water-carrier,
proudly showing us his goat-skin "bottle" lying on
the floor, with the leather flap he wears between it
and his side to protect him from the damp. Here,
too, are his chain and bell, with the bright brass
and tin cups. In fact, he is quite a "swell" in his
way, and, in spite of his uncouth-looking surroundings,
manages to enjoy life by looking on the bright
side of things.</p>
<p>
"What will you do with your palace when
you leave it?" we ask, seeing that it could not
be moved unless the whole were jumbled up in
a sack, when it would be impossible to reconstruct
it.</p>

<a name="page195" id="page195"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;195]</span>
<p>
"Oh, I'd let it to some one else."</p>
<p>
"For how much?"</p>
<p>
"Well, that I'd leave to God."</p>
<p>
A glance round the interior of this strange
abode shows that there are still many materials
employed in its construction which might have been
enumerated. One or two bundles, a box and a
basket round the sides, serve to support the roof,
and from the ridge-pole hangs a bundle which we
are informed contains semolina. I once saw such a
bundle suspended from a beam in a village mosque
in which I had passed the night in the guise of a
pious Muslim, and, observing its dusty condition,
inquired how it came there.</p>
<p>
"A traveller left it there about a year and a
half ago, and has not yet come for it," was the
reply; to judge from which it might remain till
Doomsday&mdash;a fact which spoke well for the honesty
of the country folk in that respect at least,
although I learned that they were notorious highwaymen.</p>
<p>
Though the roof admits daylight every few
inches, the occupier remarks that it keeps the sun
and rain off fairly well, and seems to think none
the worse of it for its transparent faults. A sick
woman lying in a native hut with a thatched roof
hardly in better condition than this one, remarked
when a visitor observed a big hole just above her
pallet bed&mdash;</p>
<p>
"Oh, it's so nice in the summer time; it lets
the breeze in so delightfully!"</p>
<p>
It was then the depth of winter, and she had
had to shift her position once or twice to avoid the
rain which came through that hole. What a lesson<a name="page196" id="page196"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;196]</span>
in making the best of things did not that ignorant
invalid teach!</p>
<p>
Having bid the amiable water-carrier "à Dieu,"&mdash;literally
as well as figuratively&mdash;we turn towards
a group of tents further up, whence a white-robed
form has been beckoning us. After the usual salutations
have been exchanged, the eager inquiry is
made, "Is there a steamer yet?"</p>
<p>
"No; I've nothing to do with steamers&mdash;but
there's sure to be one soon."</p>
<p>
A man who evidently disbelieves me calls out,
"I've got my money for the passage, and I'll hire
a place with you, only bring the ship quickly."</p>
<p>
Since their arrival in Tangier they have learnt
to call a steamer, which they have never seen before,&mdash;or
even the sea,&mdash;a "bábor," a corruption of the
Spanish "vapor," for Arabic knows neither "v"
nor "p."</p>
<p>
Another now comes forward to know if there
is an eye-doctor in the place, for there is a mist
before his eyes, as he is well-advanced in the decline
of life. The sound of the word "doctor" brings up
a few more of the bystanders, who ask if I am one,
and as I reply in the negative, they ask who can
cure their ears, legs, stomachs, and what not. I
explain where they may find an excellent doctor,
who will be glad to do all he can for them gratis&mdash;whereat
they open their eyes incredulously,&mdash;and
that for God's sake, in the name of Seyïdná Aïsa
("Our Lord Jesus"), which they appreciate at once
with murmurs of satisfaction, though they are not
quite satisfied until they have ascertained by further
questioning that he receives no support from his
own or any other government. Hearing the name<a name="page197" id="page197"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;197]</span>
of Seyïdná Aïsa, one of the group breaks out into
"El hamdu l'Illah, el hamdu l'Illah" ("Praise be to
God"), a snatch of a missionary hymn to a "Moody
and Sankey" tune, barely recognizable as he renders
it. He has only been here a fortnight, and disclaims
all further knowledge of the hymn or where he
heard it.</p>
<p>
Before another tent hard by sits a native barber,
bleeding a youth from a vein in the arm, for which
the fee is about five farthings. As one or two come
round to look on, he remarks, in an off-hand way&mdash;probably
with a view to increasing his practice&mdash;that
"all the pilgrims are having this done; it's
good for the internals."</p>
<p>
As we turn round to pass between two of the
tents to the row beyond, our progress is stayed by
a cord from the ridge of one to that of another, on
which are strung strips of what appear at first
sight to be leather, but on a closer inspection are
found to be pieces of meat, tripe, and apparently
chitterlings, hung out to dry in a sun temperature
of from 90° to 100° Fahrenheit. Thus is prepared
a staple article of diet for winter consumption when
fresh meat is dear, or for use on journeys, and this
is all the meat these pilgrims will taste till they
reach Mekka, or perhaps till they return. Big jars
of it, with the interstices filled up with butter, are
stowed away in the tents "among the stuff." It is
called "khalia," and is much esteemed for its tasty
and reputed aphrodisiac qualities&mdash;two ideals in
Morocco cookery,&mdash;so that it commands a relatively
good price in the market.</p>
<p>
The inmates of the next tent we look into are a
woman and two men, lying down curled up asleep<a name="page198" id="page198"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;198]</span>
in their blankets, while a couple more of the latter
squat at the door. Having noticed our curious
glances at their khalia, they, with the expressive
motion of the closed fist which in native gesture-parlance
signifies first-rate, endeavour to impress us
with a sense of its excellence, which we do not feel
inclined to dispute after all we have eaten on former
occasions. This brings us to inquire what else
these wanderers provide for the journey of thirteen
or fourteen days one way. As bread is not to be
obtained on board, at the door of the tent a tray-full
of pieces are being converted into sun-dried rusks.
Others are provided with a kind of very hard doughnut
called "fikáks." These are flavoured with anise
and carraway seeds, and are very acceptable to a
hungry traveller when bread is scarce, though fearfully
searching to hollow teeth.</p>
<p>
Then there is a goodly supply of the national
food, kesk'soo or siksoo, better known by its
Spanish name of couscoussoo. This forms an
appetizing and lordly dish, provocative of abundant
eructations&mdash;a sign of good breeding in these
parts, wound up with a long-drawn "Praise be to
God"&mdash;at the close of a regular "tuck in" with
Nature's spoon, the fist. A similar preparation is
hand-rolled vermicelli, cooked in broth or milk, if
obtainable. A bag of semolina and another of zummeetah&mdash;parched
flour&mdash;which only needs enough
moisture to form it into a paste to prepare it for
consumption, are two other well-patronized items.</p>
<p>
A quaint story comes to mind <i>à propos</i> of the
latter, which formed part of our stock of provisions
during a journey through the province of Dukkála
when the incident in question occurred. A tin of<a name="page199" id="page199"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;199]</span>
insect powder was also among our goods, and
by an odd coincidence both were relegated to
the pail hanging from one of our packs. Under a
spreading fig-tree near the village of Smeerah, at
lunch, some travelling companions offered us a cup
of tea, and among other dainties placed at their
disposal in return was the bag of zummeetah, of
which one of them made a good meal. Later on
in the day, as we rested again, he complained of
fearful internal gripings, which were easily explained
by the discovery of the fact that the lid of the "flea's
zummeetah," as one of our men styled it, had been
left open, and a hole in the sack of "man's zummeetah"
had allowed the two to mix in the bottom
of the pail in nearly equal proportions. When this
had been explained, no one entered more heartily
into the joke than its victim, which spoke very well
for his good temper, considering how seriously he
had been affected.</p>
<p>
But this is rather a digression from our catalogue
of the pilgrim's stock of provisions. Rancid
butter melted down in pots, honey, dates, figs,
raisins, and one or two similar items form the remainder.
Water is carried in goat-skins or in pots
made of the dried rind of a gourd, by far the most
convenient for a journey, owing to their light weight
and the absence of the prevailing taste of pitch
imparted by the leather contrivances. Several of
these latter are to be seen before the tents hanging
on tripods. One of the Moors informs us that for
the first day on board they have to provide their
own water, after which it is found for them, but
everything else they take with them. An ebony-hued
son of Ham, seated by a neighbouring tent,<a name="page200" id="page200"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;200]</span>
replies to our query as to what he is providing,
"I take nothing," pointing heavenward to indicate
his reliance on Divine providence.</p>
<p>
And so they travel. The group before us has
come from the Sáhara, a month's long journey
overland, on foot! Yet their travels have only
commenced. Can they have realized what it all
means?</p>

<h2>RETURNING HOME</h2>

<p class="center1">
"He lengthened absence, and returned unwelcomed."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Evening is about to fall&mdash;for fall it does in these
south latitudes, with hardly any twilight&mdash;and the
setting sun has lit the sky with a refulgent glow
that must be gazed at to be understood&mdash;the arc of
heaven overspread with glorious colour, in its turn
reflected by the heaving sea. One sound alone is
heard as I wend my way along the sandy shore; it
is the heavy thud and aftersplash of each gigantic
wave, as it breaks on the beach, and hurls itself on
its retreating predecessor, each climbing one step
higher than the last.</p>
<p>
There, in the distance, stands a motley group&mdash;men,
women, children&mdash;straining wearied eyes to
recognize the forms which crowd a cargo lighter
slowly nearing land. Away in the direction of
their looks I dimly see the outline of the pilgrim
ship, a Cardiff coaler, which has brought close on a
thousand Hájes from Port Saïd or Alexandria&mdash;men
chiefly, but among them wives and children&mdash;who
have paid that toilsome pilgrimage to Mekka.</p>
<p>
The last rays of the sun alone remain as the
boat strikes the shore, and as the darkness falls
apace a score of dusky forms make a wild rush into<a name="page202" id="page202"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;202]</span>
the surging waters, while an equal number rise up
eager in the boat to greet their friends. So soon
as they are near enough to be distinguished one
from another, each watcher on the beach shouts the
name of the friend he is awaiting, proud to affix, for
the first time, the title Háj&mdash;Pilgrim&mdash;to his name.
As only some twenty or thirty have yet landed
from among so many hundreds, the number of disappointed
ones who have to turn back and bide
their time is proportionately large.</p>
<p>
"Háj Mohammed! Háj Abd es-Slám! Háj
el Arbi! Háj boo Sháïb! Ah, Háj Drees!" and
many such ejaculations burst from their lips, together
with inquiries as to whether So-and-so may be on
board. One by one the weary travellers once more
step upon the land which is their home, and with
assistance from their friends unload their luggage.</p>
<p>
Now a touching scene ensues. Strong men fall
on one another's necks like girls, kissing and embracing
with true joy, each uttering a perfect volley
of inquiries, compliments, congratulations, or condolence.
Then, with child-like simplicity, the stayer-at-home
leads his welcome relative or friend by the
hand to the spot where his luggage has been
deposited, and seating themselves thereon they
soon get deep into a conversation which renders
them oblivious to all around, as the one relates the
wonders of his journeyings, the other the news of
home.</p>
<p>
Poor creatures! Some months ago they started,
full of hope, on an especially trying voyage of
several weeks, cramped more closely than emigrants,
exposed both to sun and rain, with hardly a change
of clothing, and only the food they had brought with<a name="page203" id="page203"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;203]</span>
them. Arrived at their destination, a weary march
across country began, and was repeated after they
had visited the various points, and performed the
various rites prescribed by the Korán or custom,
finally returning as they went, but not all, as the
sorrow-stricken faces of some among the waiters
on the beach had told, and the muttered exclamation,
"It is written&mdash;<i>Mektoob</i>."</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the night has come. The Creator's
loving Hand has caused a myriad stars to shine
forth from the darkness, in some measure to
replace the light of day, while as each new boat-load
is set down the same scenes are enacted, and
the crowd grows greater and greater, the din of
voices keeping pace therewith.</p>
<p>
Donkey-men having appeared on the scene with
their patient beasts, they clamour for employment,
and those who can afford it avail themselves of their
services to get their goods transported to the city.
What goods they are, too! All sorts of products
of the East done up in boxes of the most varied
forms and colours, bundles, rolls, and bales. The
owners are apparently mere bundles of rags themselves,
but they seem no less happy for that.</p>
<p>
Seated on an eminence at one side are several
customs officers who have been delegated to inspect
these goods; their flowing garments and
generally superior attire afford a striking contrast
to the state of the returning pilgrims, or even
to that of the friends come to meet them. These
officials have their guards marching up and down
between and round about the groups, to see that
nothing is carried off without inspection.</p>
<p>
Little by little the crowd disperses; those whose<a name="page204" id="page204"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;204]</span>
friends have landed escort them to their homes,
leaving those who will have to continue their
journey overland alone, making hasty preparations
for their evening meal. The better class speedily
have tents erected, but the majority will have to
spend the night in the open air, probably in the
rain, for it is beginning to spatter already. Fires
are lit in all directions, throwing a lurid light upon
the interesting picture, and I turn my horse's head
towards home with a feeling of sadness, but at the
same time one of thankfulness that my lot was not
cast where theirs is.</p>

<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Instead of residing at the Court of the Sultan, as
might be expected, the ministers accredited to the
ruler of Morocco take up their abode in Tangier,
where they are more in touch with Europe, and
where there is greater freedom for pig-sticking.
The reason for this is that the Court is not permanently
settled anywhere, wintering successively
at one of the three capitals, Fez, Marrákesh, or
Mequinez. Every few years, when anything of
note arises; when there is an accumulation of
matters to be discussed with the Emperor, or when
a new representative has been appointed, an embassy
to Court is undertaken, usually in spring or autumn,
the best times to travel in this roadless land.</p>
<p>
What happens on these embassies has often
enough been related from the point of view of the
performers, but seldom from that of residents in the
country who know what happens, and the following
peep behind the scenes, though fortunately not
typical of all, is not exaggerated. Even more might
have been told under some heads.  As strictly<a name="page206" id="page206"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;206]</span>
applicable to no Power at present represented in
Morocco, the record is that of an imaginary embassy
from Greece some sixty or more years ago. To
prevent misconception, it may be as well to add
that it was written previous to the failure of the
mission of Sir Charles Euan Smith.</p>


<h4>I. <span class="sc">The Reception</span></h4>
<p>
In a sloop-of-war sent all the way from the
&AElig;gean, the Ambassador and his suite sailed from
Tangier to Saffi, where His Excellency was received
on landing by a Royal salute from the crumbling
batteries. The local governor and the Greek vice-consul
awaited him on leaving the surf boat, with
an escort which sadly upset the operations of women
washing wool by the water-port. Outside the land-gate,
beside the ancient palace, was pitched a
Moorish camp awaiting his arrival, and European
additions were soon erected beside it. At daybreak
next morning a luncheon-party rode forward,
whose duty it was to prepare the midday meal for
the embassy, and to pitch the awning under which
they should partake of it.</p>
<p>
Arrived at the spot selected, Drees, the "native
agent," found the village sheïkh awaiting him with
ample supplies, enough for every one for a couple of
days. This he carefully packed on his mules, and
by the time the embassy came up, having started
some time later than he, after a good breakfast, he
was ready to go on again with the remainder of the
muleteers and the camel-drivers to prepare the
evening meal and pitch for the night a camp over
which waved the flag of Greece.</p>
<p>
Here the offerings of provisions or money were<a name="page207" id="page207"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;207]</span>
made with equal profusion. There were bushels of
kesk'soo; there were several live sheep, which were
speedily despatched and put into pots to cook;
there were jars of honey, of oil, and of butter;
there were camel-loads of barley for the beasts of
burden, and trusses of hay for their dessert; there
were packets of candles by the dozen, and loaves of
sugar and pounds of tea; not to speak of fowls,
of charcoal, of sweet herbs, of fruits, and of minor
odds and ends.</p>
<p>
By the time the Europeans arrived, their French
<i>chef</i> had prepared an excellent dinner, the native
escort and servants squatting in groups round
steaming dishes provided ready cooked by half-starved
villagers. When the feasting was over, and
all seemed quiet, a busy scene was in reality being
enacted in the background. At a little distance
from the camp, Háj Marti, the right-hand man of
the agent, was holding a veritable market with the
surplus mona of the day, re-selling to the miserable
country folk what had been wrung from them by the
authorities. The Moorish Government declared
that what they paid thus in kind would be deducted
from their taxes, and this was what the Minister
assured his questioning wife, for though he knew
better, he found it best to wink at the proceedings
of his unpaid henchman.</p>
<p>
As they proceeded inland, on the border of each
local jurisdiction the escort was changed with an
exhibition of "powder-play," the old one retiring as
the new one advanced with the governor at its
head. Thus they journeyed for about a week, till
they reached the crumbling walls of palm-begirt
Marrákesh.</p>

<a name="page208" id="page208"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;208]</span>
  <p>
The official <i>personnel</i> of the embassy consisted
of the Minister and his secretary Nikolaki Glymenopoulos,
with Ayush ben Lezrá, the interpreter. The
secretary was a self-confident dandy with a head
like a pumpkin and a scrawl like the footprints
of a wandering hen; reputed a judge of ladies and
horse-flesh; supercilious, condescending to inferiors,
and the plague of his tailor. The consul, Paolo
Komnenos, a man of middle age with a kindly heart,
yet without force of character to withstand the evils
around him, had been left in Tangier as <i>Chargé
d'Affaires</i>, to the great satisfaction of his wife and
family, who considered themselves of the <i>crême de
la crême</i> of Tangier society, such as it was, because,
however much the wife of the Minister despised
the bumptiousness of Madame Komnenos, she
could not omit her from her invitations, unless of
the most private nature, on account of her husband's
official position. Now, as Madame Mavrogordato
accompanied her husband with her little son and
a lady friend, the consul's wife reigned supreme.</p>
<p>
Then there were the official <i>attachés</i> for the
occasion, the representative of the army, a colonel
of Roman nose, and eyes which required but one
glass between them, a man to whom death would
have been preferable to going one morning unshaved,
or to failing one jot in military etiquette; and the
representative of the navy, in cocked hat and gold-striped
pantaloons, who found it more difficult to
avoid tripping over his sword than most landsmen
do to keep from stumbling over coils of rope
on ship-board; beyond his costume there was little
of note about him; his genial character made it
easy to say "Ay, ay," to any one, but the yarns he<a name="page209" id="page209"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;209]</span>
could spin round the camp-fire made him a general
favourite. The least consequential of the party was
the doctor, an army man of honest parts, who wished
well to all the world. Undoubtedly he was the
hardest worked of the lot, for no one else did anything
but enjoy himself.</p>
<p>
Finally there were the "officious" <i>attachés</i>.
Every dabbler in politics abroad knows the fine
distinctions between "official" and "officious" action,
and how subtle are the changes which can be rung
upon the two, but there was nothing of that description
here. The officious <i>attachés</i> were simply a
party of the Minister's personal friends, and two or
three strangers whose influence might in after times
be useful to him. One was of course a journalist,
to supply the special correspondence of the <i>Acropolis</i>
and the <i>Hellenike Salpinx</i>. These would afterwards
be worked up into a handy illustrated volume of
experiences and impressions calculated to further
deceive the public with regard to Morocco and the
Moors, and to secure for the Minister his patron,
the longed-for promotion to a European Court.
Another was necessarily the artist of the party,
while the remainder engaged in sport of one kind
or another.</p>
<p>
Si Drees, the "native agent," was employed as
master of horse, and superintended the native
arrangements generally. With him rested every
detail of camping out, and the supply of food and
labour. Right and left he was the indispensable
factotum, shouting himself hoarse from before dawn
till after sunset, when he joined the gay blades of
the Embassy in private pulls at forbidden liquors.
No one worked as hard as he, and he seemed<a name="page210" id="page210"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;210]</span>
omnipresent. The foreigners were justly thankful to
have such a man, for without him all felt at sea.
He appeared to know everything and to be available
for every one's assistance. The only draw-back was
his ignorance of Greek, or of any language but his
own, yet being sharp-witted he made himself
wonderfully understood by signs and a few words
of the strange coast jargon, a mixture of half a
dozen tongues.</p>
<p>
The early morning was fixed for the solemn
entry of the Embassy into the city, yet the road
had to be lined on both sides with soldiers to keep
back the thronging crowds. Amid the din of multitudes,
the clashing of barbarous music, and shrill
ululations of delight from native women; surrounded
by an eastern blaze of sun and blended colours,
rode incongruous the Envoy from Greece. His stiff,
grim figure, the embodiment of officialism, in full
Court dress, was supported on either hand by his
secretary and interpreter, almost as resplendent as
himself. Behind His Excellency rode the <i>attachés</i>
and other officials, then the ladies; newspaper correspondents,
artists, and other non-official guests,
bringing up the rear. In this order the party
crossed the red-flowing Tansift by its low bridge
of many arches, and drew near to the gate of
Marrákesh called that of the Thursday [market],
Báb el Khamees.</p>

<b>A CITY GATEWAY IN MOROCCO.</b>
</p><br /><br />

<p>
At last they commenced to thread the narrow
winding streets, their bordering roofs close packed
with shrouded figures only showing an eye, who
greeted them after their fashion with a piercing,
long-drawn, "Yoo-yoo, yoo-yoo; yoo-yoo, yoo-yoo;
yoo-yoo, yoo-yoo&mdash;oo," so novel to the strangers,<a name="page211" id="page211"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;211]</span>
and so typical. Then they crossed the wide-open
space before the Kûtûbîyah on their way to the
garden which had been prepared for them, the
Mamûnîyah, with its handsome residence and shady
walks.</p>
<p>
Three days had to elapse from the time of their
arrival before they could see the Sultan, for they
were now under native etiquette, but they had much
to occupy them, much to see and think about,
though supposed to remain at home and rest till the
audience. On the morning of the fourth day all was
bustle. Each had to array himself in such official
garb as he could muster, with every decoration he
could borrow, for the imposing ceremony of the
presentation to the Emperor. What a business it
was! what a coming and going; what noise and
what excitement! It was like living in the thick of
a whirling pantomime.</p>
<p>
At length they were under way, and making
towards the kasbah gate in a style surpassing that
of their entry, the populace still more excited at the
sight of the gold lace and cocked hats which showed
what great men had come to pay their homage to
their lord the Sultan. On arrival at the inmost
courtyard with whitewashed, battlemented walls,
and green-tiled roofs beyond, they found it thickly
lined with soldiers, a clear space being left for them
in the centre. Here they were all ranged on foot,
the presents from King Otho placed on one side,
and covered with rich silk cloths. Presently a blast
of trumpets silenced the hum of voices, and the
soldiers made a show of "attention" in their undrilled
way, for the Sultan approached.</p>
<p>
In a moment the great doors on the other side<a name="page212" id="page212"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;212]</span>
flew open, and a number of gaily dressed natives in
peaked red caps&mdash;the Royal body-guard&mdash;emerged,
followed by five prancing steeds, magnificent barbs
of different colours, richly caparisoned, led by gold-worked
bridles. Then came the Master of the
Ceremonies in his flowing robes and monster turban,
a giant in becoming dress, and&mdash;as they soon discovered&mdash;of
stentorian voice. Behind him rode the
Emperor himself in stately majesty, clothed in pure
white, wool-white, distinct amid the mass of colours
worn by those surrounding him, his ministers. The
gorgeous trappings of his white steed glittered as
the proud beast arched his neck and champed his
gilded bit, or tried in vain to prance. Over his head
was held by a slave at his side the only sign of
Royalty, a huge red-silk umbrella with a fringe to
match, and a golden knob on the point, while others
of the household servants flicked the flies away, or
held the spurs, the cushion, the carpet, and other
things which might be called for by their lord.</p>
<p>
On his appearance deafening shouts broke forth,
"God bless our Lord, and give him victory!" The
rows of soldiers bowed their heads and repeated the
cry with still an increase of vigour, "God bless our
Lord, and give him victory!" At a motion from
the Master of the Ceremonies the members of the
Embassy took off their hats or helmets, and the
representative of modern Greece stood there bareheaded
in a broiling sun before the figure-head of
ancient Barbary. As the Sultan approached the
place where he stood, he drew near and offered a
few stereotyped words in explanation of his errand,
learned by heart, to which the Emperor replied by
bidding him welcome. The Minister then handed<a name="page213" id="page213"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;213]</span>
to him an engrossed address in a silk embroided
case, which an attendant was motioned to take, the
Sultan acknowledging it graciously. One by one
the Minister next introduced the members of his
suite, their names and qualities being shouted in
awful tones by the Master of the Ceremonies, and
after once more bidding them welcome, but with a
scowl at the sight of Drees, His Majesty turned his
horse's head, leaving them to re-mount as their steeds
were brought to them. Again the music struck up
with a deafening din, and the state reception was
over.</p>
<p>
But this was not to be the only interview between
the Ambassador and the Sultan, for several so-called
private conferences followed, at which an
attendant or two and the interpreter Ayush were
present. Kyrios Mavrogordato's stock of polite
workable Arabic had been exhausted at the public
function, and for business matters he had to rely
implicitly on the services of his handy Jew. Such
other notions of the language as he boasted could
only be addressed to inferiors, and that but to
convey the most simple of crude instructions or
curses.</p>
<p>
At the first private audience there were many
matters of importance to be brought before the
Sultan's notice, afterwards to be relegated to the
consideration of his wazeers. This time no fuss
was made, and the affair again came off in the early
morning, for His Majesty rose at three, and after
devotions and study transacted official business from
five to nine, then breakfasting and reserving the
rest of the day for recreation and further religious
study.</p>

<h4>II. <span class="sc">The Interview</span></h4>

<p>
At the appointed time an escort waited on the
Ambassador<a name="XXV1r" id="XXV1r"></a><a href="#XXV1"><sup>*</sup></a> to convey him to the palace, arrived
at which he was led into one of the many gardens
in the interior, full of luxuriant semi-wild vegetation.
In a room opening on to one side of the garden
sat the Emperor, tailor-fashion, on a European sofa,
elevated by a sort of daïs opposite the door. With
the exception of an armchair on the lower level,
to which the Ambassador was motioned after the
usual formal obeisances and expressions of respect,
the chamber was absolutely bare of furniture, though
not lacking in beauty of decoration. The floor was
of plain cut but elegant tiles, and the dado was a
more intricate pattern of the same in shades of
blue, green, and yellow, interspersed with black, but
relieved by an abundance of greeny white. Above
this, to the stalactite cornice, the walls were decorated
with intricate Mauresque designs in carved white
plaster, while the rich stalactite roofing of deep-red
tone, just tipped with purple and gilt, made a perfect
whole, and gave a feeling of repose to the design.
Through the huge open horse-shoe arch of the
door the light streamed between the branches of
graceful creepers waving in the breeze, adding to
the impression of coolness caused by the bubbling
fountain outside.</p>
<p>
"May God bless our Lord, and prolong his
days!" said Ayush, bowing profoundly towards the
Sultan, as the Minister concluded the repetition
of his stock phrases, and seated himself.</p>
<p>
"May it please Your Majesty," began the<a name="page215" id="page215"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;215]</span>
Minister, in Greek, "I cannot express the honour
I feel in again being commissioned to approach
Your Majesty in the capacity of Ambassador from
my Sovereign, King Otho of Greece."</p>
<p>
This little speech was rendered into Arabic by
Ayush to this effect&mdash;</p>
<p>
"May God pour blessings on our Lord. The
Ambassador rejoices greatly, and is honoured above
measure in being sent once more by his king to
approach the presence of our Lord, the high and
mighty Sovereign: yes, my Lord."</p>
<p>
"He is welcome," answered the Sultan, graciously;
"we love no nation better than the Greeks.
They have always been our friends."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty is delighted to see
Your Excellency, whom he loves from his heart,
as also your mighty nation, than which none is
more dear to him, and whose friendship he is ready
to maintain at any cost."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "It pleases me greatly to hear Your
Majesty's noble sentiments, which I, and I am sure
my Government, reciprocate."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "The Minister is highly complimented
by the gracious words of our Lord, and
declares that the Greeks love no other nation on
earth beside the Moors: yes, my Lord."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "Is there anything I can do for such
good friends?"</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty says he is ready
to do anything for so good a friend as Your
Excellency."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "I am deeply grateful to His
Majesty. Yes, there are one or two matters which
my Government would like to have settled."</p>

<a name="page216" id="page216"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;216]</span>
 <p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "The Minister is simply overwhelmed
at the thought of the consideration of
our Lord, and he has some trifling matters for
which perhaps he may beg our Lord's attention:
yes, my Lord."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "He has only to make them known."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty will do all Your
Excellency desires."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "First then, Your Majesty, there is
the little affair of the Greek who was murdered
last year at Azîla. I am sure that I can rely on
an indemnity for his widow."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "The Minister speaks of the
Greek who was murdered&mdash;by your leave, yes, my
Lord&mdash;at Azîla last year: yes, my Lord. The
Ambassador wishes him to be paid for."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "How much does he ask?"</p>
<p>
This being duly interpreted, the Minister
replied&mdash;</p>
<p>
"Thirty thousand dollars."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "Half that sum would do, but we will
see. What next?"</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty thinks that too
much, but as Your Excellency says, so be it."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "I thank His Majesty, and beg to
bring to his notice the imprisonment of a Greek
<i>protégé</i>, Mesaûd bin Aûdah, at Mazagan some
months ago, and to ask for his liberation and for
damages. This is a most important case."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "The Minister wants that thief
Mesaûd bin Aûdah, whom the Báshá of Mazagan
has in gaol, to be let out, and he asks also for
damages: yes, my Lord."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "The man was no lawful <i>protégé</i>. I<a name="page217" id="page217"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;217]</span>
can do nothing in the case.  Bin Aûdah is a
criminal, and cannot be protected."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty fears that this is a
matter in which he cannot oblige Your Excellency,
much as he would like to, since the man in question
is a thief. It is no use saying anything further
about this."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "Then ask about that Jew Botbol,
who was thrashed. Though not a <i>protégé</i>, His
Majesty might be able to do something."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Excellency brings before
our Lord a most serious matter indeed; yes, my
Lord. It is absolutely necessary that redress should
be granted to Maimon Botbol, the eminent
merchant of Mogador whom the kaïd of that place
most brutally treated last year: yes, my Lord.
And this is most important, for Botbol is a
great friend of His Excellency, who has taken the
treatment that the poor man received very much to
heart. He is sure that our Lord will not hesitate
to order the payment of the damages demanded,
only fifty thousand dollars."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "In consideration of the stress the
Minister lays upon this case, he shall have ten
thousand dollars."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty will pay Your
Excellency ten thousand dollars damages."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "As that is more than I had even
hoped to ask, you will duly thank His Majesty
most heartily for this spontaneous generosity."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "The Minister says that is not
sufficient from our Lord, but he will not oppose his
will: yes, my Lord."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "I cannot do more."</p>

<a name="page218" id="page218"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;218]</span>
 <p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty says it gives him
great pleasure to pay it."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "Now there is the question of
slavery. I have here a petition from a great
society at Athens requesting His Majesty to consider
whether he cannot abolish the system throughout
his realm," handing the Sultan an elaborate
Arabic scroll in Syrian characters hard to be
deciphered even by the secretary to whom it is
consigned for perusal; the Sultan, though an
Arabic scholar, not taking sufficient interest in the
matter to think of it again.</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "There are some fanatics in the
land of Greece, yes, my Lord, who want to see
slavery abolished here, by thy leave, yes, my Lord,
but I will explain to the Bashador that this is
impossible."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "Certainly. It is an unalterable institution.
Those who think otherwise are fools.
Besides, your agent Drees deals in slaves!"</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty will give the petition
his best attention, and if possible grant it with
pleasure."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "You will thank His Majesty very
much. It will rejoice my fellow-countrymen to
hear it. Next, a Greek firm has offered to construct
the much-needed port at Tangier, if His
Majesty will grant us the concession till the work
be paid for by the tolls. Such a measure would
tend to greatly increase the Moorish revenues."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "The Minister wishes to build a
port at Tangier, yes, my Lord, and to hold it till
the tolls have paid for it."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "Which may not be till Doomsday.<a name="page219" id="page219"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;219]</span>
Nevertheless, I will consent to any one making the
port whom all the European representatives shall
agree to appoint"&mdash;a very safe promise to make,
since the Emperor knew that this agreement was
not likely to be brought about till the said Domesday.</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "Your Excellency's request is
granted. You have only to obtain the approval of
your colleagues."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "His Majesty is exceedingly gracious,
and I am correspondingly obliged to him. Inform
His Majesty that the same firm is willing to build
him bridges over his rivers, and to make roads
between the provinces, which would increase friendly
communications, and consequently tend to reduce
inter-tribal feuds."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "The Minister thanks our Lord,
and wants also to build bridges and roads in the
interior to make the tribes friendly by intercourse."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "That would never do. The more I
keep the tribes apart the better for me. If I did
not shake up my rats in the sack pretty often, they
would gnaw their way out. Besides, where my
people could travel more easily, so could foreign
invaders. No, I cannot think of such a thing.
God created the world without bridges."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty is full of regret that
in this matter he is unable to please Your Excellency,
but he thinks his country better as it is."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "Although I beg to differ from His
Majesty, so be it. Next there is the question of
our commerce with Morocco. This is greatly
hampered by the present lack of a fixed customs
tariff.  There are several articles of which the<a name="page220" id="page220"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;220]</span>
exportation is now prohibited, which it would be
really very much in the interest of his people to
allow us to purchase."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "The Minister requests of our
Lord a new customs tariff, and the right to export
wheat and barley."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "The tariff he may discuss with the
Wazeer of the Interior; I will give instructions.
As for the cereals, the bread of the Faithful cannot
be given to infidels."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty accedes to your
Excellency's request. You have only to make
known the details to the Minister for Internal
Affairs."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "Again I humbly render thanks to
his Majesty. Since he is so particularly good to
me, perhaps he would add one kindness more, in
abandoning to me the old house and garden on the
Marshan at Tangier, in which the Foreign Minister
used to live. It is good for nothing, and would be
useful to me."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "The Minister asks our Lord for a
couple of houses in Tangier. Yes, my Lord, the
one formerly occupied by the Foreign Minister on
the Marshan at Tangier for himself; and the other
adjoining the New Mosque in town, just an old
tumble-down place for stores, to be bestowed upon
me; yes, my Lord."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "What sort of place is that on the
Marshan?"</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "I will not lie unto my lord. It
is a fine big house in a large garden, with wells and
fruit trees: yes, my Lord. But the other is a mere
nothing: yes, my Lord."</p>

<a name="page221" id="page221"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;221]</span>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "I will do as he wishes&mdash;if it please
God." (The latter expression showing the reverse
of an intention to carry out the former.)</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty gives you the house."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "His Majesty is indeed too kind to
me. I therefore regret exceedingly having to bring
forward a number of claims which have been pending
for a long time, but with the details of which I
will not of course trouble His Majesty personally.
I merely desire his instructions to the Treasury to
discharge them on their being admitted by the competent
authorities."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "The Minister brings before our
Lord a number of claims, on the settlement of which
he insists: yes, my Lord. He feels it a disgrace
that they should have remained unpaid so long:
yes, my Lord. And he asks for orders to be given
to discharge them at once."</p>
<p>
<i>Sultan.</i> "There is neither force nor power
save in God, the High, the Mighty. Glory to
Him! There is no telling what these Nazarenes
won't demand next. I will pay all just claims, of
course, but many of these are usurers' frauds, with
which I will have nothing to do."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Majesty will give the necessary
instructions; but the claims will have to be
examined, as Your Excellency has already suggested.
His Majesty makes the sign of the conclusion
of our interview."</p>
<p>
<i>Minister.</i> "Assure His Majesty how deeply
indebted I am to him for these favours he has
shown me, but allow me to in some measure
acknowledge them by giving information of importance.
I am entirely <i>au courant</i>, through private<a name="page222" id="page222"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;222]</span>
channels, with the unworthy tactics of the British
Minister, as also those of his two-faced colleagues,
the representatives of France and Spain, and can
disclose them to His Majesty whenever he desires."</p>
<p>
<i>Interpreter.</i> "His Excellency does not know
how to express his gratitude to our Lord for his
undeserved and unprecedented condescension, and
feels himself bound the slave of our Lord, willing
to do all our Lord requires of his hands; yes, my
lord. But he trusts that our Lord will not forget
the houses&mdash;and the one in town is only a little one,&mdash;or
the payment of the indemnity to Maimon
Botbol, yes, my Lord, or the discharging of the
claims. God bless our Lord, and give him victory!
And also, pardon me, my Lord, the Minister says
that all the other ministers are rogues, and he
knows all about them that our Lord may wish to
learn: yes, my Lord."</p>
<p>
"God is omniscient. He can talk of those
matters to the Foreign Minister to-morrow. In
peace!"</p>
<p>
Once more a few of his stock phrases were
man&oelig;uvred by Kyrios Mavrogordato, as with the
most profound of rear-steering bows the representatives
of civilization retreated, and the potentate of
Barbary turned with an air of relief to give instructions
to his secretary.</p>

<h4>"OUR INTERESTS IN MOROCCO</h4>

<p class="center1">"
(<i>From our Special Correspondent</i>)</p>
<p class="author">
"Marrákesh, October 20.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The success of our Embassy to Morocco is already
assured, and that in a remarkable degree. The Sultan has
once more shown most unequivocally his strong partiality
for the Greek nation, and especially for their distinguished
representative, Kyrios Dimitri Mavrogordato, whose personal
tact and influence have so largely contributed to
this most thankworthy result. It is very many years since
such a number of requests have been granted by the
Emperor of Morocco to one ambassador, and it is probable
that under the most favourable circumstances no other
Power could have hoped for such an exhibition of favour.</p>
<p>
"The importance of the concessions is sufficient to mark
this embassy in the history of European relations with
Morocco, independently of the amount of ordinary business
transacted, and the way in which the Sultan has promised
to satisfy our outstanding claims. Among other favours,
permission has been granted to a Greek firm to construct
a port at Tangier, the chief seat of foreign trade in the
Empire, which is a matter of national importance, and
there is every likelihood of equally valuable concessions
for the building of roads and bridges being made to the
same company.</p>
<p>
"Our merchants will be rejoiced to learn that at last
the vexatious customs regulations, or rather the absence
of them, will be replaced by a regular tariff, which our
minister has practically only to draw up for it to be
sanctioned by the Moorish Government. The question of
slavery, too, is under the consideration of the Sultan with
a view to its restriction, if not to its abolition, a distinct
and unexpected triumph for the friends of universal
freedom. There can be no question that, under its present
enlightened ruler, Morocco is at last on the high-road to
civilization.</p>
<p>
"Only those who have had experience in dealing with<a name="page224" id="page224"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;224]</span>
procrastinating politicians of the eastern school can appreciate
in any degree the consummate skill and patience
which is requisite to overcome the sinuosities of oriental
minds, and it is only such a signal victory as has just been
won for Greece and for progress in Morocco, as can enable
us to realize the value to the State of such diplomatists as
His Excellency, Kyrios Mavrogordato."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This article had not appeared in print before
affairs on the spot wore a very different complexion.
At the interview with the Minister for the
Interior a most elaborate customs tariff had been
presented and discussed, some trifling alterations
being made, and the whole being left to be submitted
to the Sultan for his final approval, with the
assurance that this was only a matter of form. The
Minister of Finance had promised most blandly the
payment of the damages demanded for the murder
of the Greek and for the thrashing of the Jew. It
was true that as yet no written document had been
handed to the Greek Ambassador, but then he had
the word of the Ministers themselves, and promises
from the Sultan's lips as well. The only <i>fait
accompli</i> was the despatch of a courier to Tangier
with orders to deliver up the keys of two specified
properties to the Ambassador and his interpreter
respectively, a matter which, strange to say, found
no place in the messages to the Press, and in which
the spontaneous present to the interpreter struck
His Excellency as a most generous act on the part
of the Sultan.</p>
<p>
Quite a number of state banquets had been
given, in which the members of the Embassy had
obtained an insight into stylish native cooking,
writing home that half the dishes were prepared<a name="page225" id="page225"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;225]</span>
with pomatum and the other half with rancid oil
and butter. The <i>littérateur</i> of the party had nearly
completed his work on Morocco, and was seriously
thinking of a second volume. The young <i>attachés</i>
could swear right roundly in Arabic, and were becoming
perfect connoisseurs of native beauty. In
the palatial residence of Drees, as well as in a
private residence which that worthy had placed at
their disposal, they had enjoyed a selection of native
female society, and had such good times under the
wing of that "rare old cock," as they dubbed him,
that one or two began to feel as though they had
lighted among the lotus eaters, and had little desire
to return.</p>
<p>
But to Kyrios Mavrogordato and Glymenopoulos
his secretary, the delay at Court began to
grow irksome, and they heartily wished themselves
back in Tangier. Notwithstanding the useful "tips"
which he had given to the Foreign Minister regarding
the base designs of his various colleagues
accredited to that Court, his own affairs seemed to
hang fire. He had shown how France was determined
to make war upon Morocco sooner or later,
with a view to adding its fair plains to those it was
acquiring in Algeria, and had warned him that if the
Sultan lent assistance to the Ameer Abd el Káder
he would certainly bring this trouble upon himself.
He had also shown how England pretended friendship
because at any cost she must maintain at least
the neutrality of that part of his country bordering
on the Straits of Gibraltar, and that with all her
professions of esteem, she really cared not a straw
for the Moors. He had shown too that puny Spain
held it as an article of faith that Morocco should<a name="page226" id="page226"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;226]</span>
one day become hers in return for the rule of the
Moors upon her own soil. He had, in fact, shown
that Greece alone cared for the real interests of the
Sultan.</p>

<br />

<h4>IV. <span class="sc">Diamond Cut Diamond</span></h4>
<p>
Yet things did not move. The treaty of commerce
remained unsigned, and slaves were still
bought and sold. The numerous claims which he
had to enforce had only been passed in part, and
the Moorish authorities seemed inclined to dispute
the others stoutly. At last, at a private conference
with the Wazeer el Kiddáb, the Ambassador
broached a proposal to cut the Gordian knot.
He would abandon all disputed claims for a lump
sum paid privately to himself, and asked what
the Moorish Government might feel inclined to
offer.</p>
<p>
The Wazeer el Kiddáb received this proposal
with great complacency. He was accustomed to
such overtures. Every day of his life that style of
bargain was part of his business. But this was the
first time that a European ambassador had made
such a suggestion in its nakedness, and he was
somewhat taken aback, though his studied indifference
of manner did not allow the foreigner to suspect
such a thing for a moment. The usual style
had been for him to offer present after present to
the ambassadors till he had reached their price, and
then, when his master had overloaded them with
personal favours&mdash;many of which existed but in
promise&mdash;they had been unable to press too hard
the claims they had come to enforce, for fear of<a name="page227" id="page227"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;227]</span>
possible disclosures. So this was a novel proceeding,
though quite comprehensible on the part of a
man who had been bribed on a less extensive scale
on each previous visit to Court. Once, however,
such a proposition had been made, it was evident
that his Government could not be much in earnest
regarding demands which he could so easily afford
to set aside.</p>
<p>
As soon, therefore, as Kyrios Mavrogordato
had left, the Wazeer ordered his mule, that he
might wait upon His Majesty before the hours of
business were over. His errand being stated as
urgent and private, he was admitted without delay
to his sovereign's presence.</p>
<p>
"May God prolong the days of our Lord! I
come to say that the way to rid ourselves of the
importunity of this ambassador from Greece is
plain. He has made it so himself by offering to
abandon all disputed claims for a round sum down
for his own use. What is the pleasure of my
Lord?"</p>
<p>
"God is great!" exclaimed the Sultan, "that is
well. You may inform the Minister from me that
a positive refusal is given to every demand not
already allowed in writing. What <i>he</i> can afford to
abandon, <i>I</i> can't afford to pay."</p>
<p>
"The will of our Lord shall be done."</p>
<p>
"But stay! I have had my eye upon that
Greek ambassador this long while, and am getting
tired of him. The abuses he commits are atrocious,
and his man Drees is a devil. Háj Taïb el Ghassál
writes that the number of his <i>protégés</i> is legion, and
that by far the greater number of them are illegal.
Inform him when you see him that henceforth the<a name="page228" id="page228"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;228]</span>
provisions of our treaties shall be strictly adhered to,
and moreover that no protection certificates shall be
valid unless countersigned by our Foreign Commissioner
El Ghassál. If I rule here, I will put an end
to this man's doings."</p>
<p>
"On my head and eyes be the words of my
Lord."</p>
<p>
"And remind him further that the permits for
the free passage of goods at the customs are granted
only for his personal use, for the necessities of his
household, and that the way Háj Taïb writes he
has been selling them is a disgrace. The man is a
regular swindler, and the less we have to do with
him the better. As for his pretended information
about his colleagues, there may be a good deal of
truth in it, but I have the word of the English
minister, who is about as honest as any of them,
that this Mavrogordato is a born villain, and that if
his Government is not greedy for my country on
its own account, it wants to sell me to some more
powerful neighbour in exchange for its protection.
Greece is only a miserable fag-end of Europe."</p>
<p>
"Our Lord knows: may God give him victory,"
and the Wazeer bowed himself out to consider how
best he might obey his instructions, not exactly
liking the task. On returning home he despatched
a messenger to the quarters of the Embassy,
appointing an hour on the morrow for a conference,
and when this came the Ambassador found himself
in for a stormy interview. The Wazeer, with his
snuff-box in constant use, sat cool and collected on
his mattress on the floor, the Ambassador sitting uneasily
on a chair before him. Though the language
used was considerably modified in filtering through<a name="page229" id="page229"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;229]</span>
the brain of the interpreter, the increasing violence
of tone and gesture could not be concealed, and
were all but sufficiently comprehensible in themselves.
The Ambassador protested that if the
remainder of the demands were to be refused, he
was entitled to at least as much as the French
representative had had to shut his mouth last time
he came to Court, and affected overwhelming indignation
at the treatment he had received.</p>
<p>
"Besides," he added, "I have the promise of
His Majesty the Sultan himself that certain of them
should be paid in full, and I cannot abandon those.
I have informed my Government of the Sultan's
words."</p>
<p>
"Dost suppose that my master is a dog of a
Nazarene, that he should keep his word to thee?
Nothing thou may'st say can alter his decision.
The claims that have been allowed in writing shall
be paid by the Customs Administrators on thy
return to Tangier. Here are orders for the
money."</p>
<p>
"I absolutely refuse to accept a portion of what
my Government demands. I will either receive
the whole, or I will return empty-handed, and
report on the treacherous way in which I have
been treated. I am thoroughly sick of the procrastinating
and prevaricating ways of this country&mdash;a
disgrace to the age."</p>
<p>
"And we are infinitely more sick of thy behaviour
and thine abuse of the favours we have
granted thee. Our lord has expressly instructed
me to tell thee that in future no excess of the rights
guaranteed to foreigners by treaty will be permitted
on any account. Thy protection certificates to be<a name="page230" id="page230"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;230]</span>
valid must be endorsed by our Foreign Commissioner,
and the nature of the goods thou importest
free of duty as for thyself shall be strictly examined,
as we have the right to do, that no more defrauding
of our revenue be permitted."</p>
<p>
"Your words are an insult to my nation," exclaimed
the Ambassador, rising, "and shall be duly
reported to my Government. I cannot sit here
and listen to vile impeachments like these; you
know them to be false!"</p>
<p>
"That is no affair of mine; I have delivered
the decision of our lord, and have no more to say.
The claims we refuse are all of them unjust, the
demands of usurers, on whom be the curse of God;
and demands for money which has never been
stolen, or has already been paid; every one of
them is a shameful fraud, God knows. Leeches
are only fit to be trodden on when they have done
their work; we want none of them."</p>
<p>
"Your language is disgraceful, such as was
never addressed to me in my life before; if I do
not receive an apology by noon to-morrow, I will
at once set out for Tangier, if not for Greece, and
warn you of the possible consequences."</p>

     <br /><hr class="short" /><br />
<p>
The excitement in certain circles in Athens on
the receipt of the intelligence that the Embassy to
Morocco had failed, after all the flourish of trumpets
with which its presumed successes had been hailed,
was great indeed. One might have thought that
once more the brave Hellenes were thirsting for
the conquest of another Sicily, to read the columns
of the <i>Palingenesia</i>, some of the milder paragraphs
of which, translated, ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<a name="page231" id="page231"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;231]</span>

<blockquote><p>
"A solemn duty has been imposed upon our nation by
the studied indignities heaped upon our representative at
the Court of Morocco. Greece has been challenged,
Europe defied, and the whole civilized world insulted.
The duty now before us is none other than to wipe from
the earth that nest of erstwhile pirates flattered by the
name of the Moorish Government....</p>
<p>
"As though it were insufficient to have refused the
just demands presented by Kyrios Mavrogordato for the
payment of business debts due to Greek merchants, and
for damages acknowledged to be due to others for property
stolen by lawless bandits, His Excellency has been
practically dismissed from the Court in a manner which
has disgraced our flag in the eyes of all Morocco.</p>
<p>
"Here are two counts which need no exaggeration.
Unless the payment of just business debts is duly enforced
by the Moorish Government, as it would be in any other
country, and unless the native agents of our merchants are
protected fully by the local authorities, it is hopeless to
think of maintaining commercial relations with such a
nation, so that insistence on these demands is of vital
necessity to our trade, and a duty to our growing manufactories.</p>
<p>
"The second count is of the simplest: such treatment
as has been meted out to our Minister Plenipotentiary in
Morocco, especially after the bland way in which he was
met at first with empty promises and smiles, is worthy
only of savages or of a people intent on war."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The <i>Hellenike Salpinx</i> was hardly less vehement
in the language in which it chronicled the
course of events in Morocco:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Notwithstanding the unprecedented manner in which
the requests of His Excellency, Kyrios Dimitri Mavrogordato,
our Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary
at the Court of Morocco, were acceded to on the
recent Embassy to Mulai Abd er-Rahmán, the Moors have
shown their true colours at last by equally marked, but
less astonishing, insults.</p>

<a name="page232" id="page232"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;232]</span>
<p>
"The unrivalled diplomatic talents of our ambassador
proved, in fact, too much for the Moorish Government,
and though the discovery of the way in which a Nazarene
was obtaining his desires from the Sultan may have
aroused the inherent obstinacy of the wazeers, and thus
produced the recoil which we have described, it is far more
likely that this was brought about by the officious interference
of one or two other foreign representatives at
Tangier. It has been for some time notorious that the
Sardinian consul-general&mdash;who at the same time represents
Portugal&mdash;loses no opportunity of undermining
Grecian influence in Morocco, and in this certain of his
colleagues have undoubtedly not been far behind him.</p>
<p>
"Nevertheless, whatever causes may have been at work
in bringing about this crisis, it is one which cannot be
tided over, but which must be fairly faced. Greece has
but one course before her."

<h2>PRISONERS AND CAPTIVES</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Misfortune is misfortune's heir."</p>
<p class="rindent"><i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Externally the gaol of Tangier does not differ
greatly in appearance from an ordinary Moorish
house, and even internally it is of the plan which
prevails throughout the native buildings from
fandaks to palaces. A door-way in a blank wall,
once whitewashed, gives access to a kind of lobby,
such as might precede the entrance to some
grandee's house, but instead of being neat and
clean, it is filthy and dank, and an unwholesome
odour pervades the air. On a low bench at the
far end lie a guard or two in dirty garments, fitting
ornaments for such a place. By them is the low-barred
entrance to the prison, with a hole in the
centre the size of such a face as often fills it, wan
and hopeless. A clanking of chains, a confused din
of voices, and an occasional moan are borne through
the opening on the stench-laden atmosphere. "All
hope abandon, ye who enter here!" could never have
been written on portal more appropriate than this,
unless he who entered had friends and money. Here
are forgotten good and bad, the tried and the untried,
just and unjust together, sunk in a night of
blank despair, a living grave.</p>

<a name="page234" id="page234"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;234]</span>
<p>
Around an open courtyard, protected by an iron
grating at the top, is a row of dirty columns, and
behind them a kind of arcade, on to which open a
number of doorless chambers. Filth is apparent
everywhere, and to the stifling odour of that unwashed
horde is added that caused by insanitary
drainage. To some of the pillars are chained poor
wretches little more than skeletons, while a cable of
considerable length secures others. It is locked
at one end to a staple outside the door under which
it passes, and is threaded through rings on the iron
collars of half a dozen prisoners who have been
brought in as rebels from a distant province. For
thirteen days they have tramped thus, carrying that
chain, holding it up by their hands to save their
shoulders, and two empty rings still threaded on
show that when they started they numbered eight.
Since the end rings are riveted to the chain, it has
been impossible to remove them, so when two fell
sick by the way the drivers cut off their heads to
effect the release of their bodies, and to prove, by
presenting those ghastly trophies at their journey's
end, that none had escaped.</p>
<p>
Many of the prisoners are busy about the floor,
where they squat in groups, plaiting baskets and
satchels of palmetto leaves, while many appear too
weak and disheartened even to earn a subsistence
in this way. One poor fellow, who has been a
courier, was employed one day twenty-five years
since to carry a despatch to Court, complaining of
the misdeeds of a governor. That official himself
intercepted the letter, and promptly despatched
the bearer to Tangier as a Sultan's prisoner. He
then arrested the writer of the letter, who, on paying<a name="page235" id="page235"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;235]</span>
a heavy fine, regained his liberty, but the courier
remained unasked for. In course of time the kaïd
was called to his account, and his son, who succeeded
him in office, having died too, a stranger
ruled in their stead. The forgotten courier had by
this time lost his reason, fancying himself once more
in his goat-hair tent on the southern plains, and
with unconscious irony he still gives every new
arrival the Arab greeting, "Welcome to thee, a
thousand welcomes! Make thyself at home and
comfortable. All before thee is thine, and what
thou seest not, be sure we don't possess."</p>
<p>
Some few, in better garments, hold themselves
aloof from the others, and converse together with all
the nonchalance of gossip in the streets, for they are
well-to-do, arrested on some trivial charge which a
few dollars apiece will soon dispose of, but they are
exceptions. A quieter group occupies one corner,
members of a party of no less than sixty-two
brought in together from Fez, on claims made
against them by a European Power. A sympathetic
inquiry soon elicits their histories.<a name="XXVI1r" id="XXVI1r"></a><a href="#XXVI1"><sup>*</sup></a> The
first man to speak is hoary and bent with years; he
was arrested several years ago, on the death of a
brother who had owed some $50 to a European.
The second had borrowed $900 in exchange for a
bond for twice that amount; he had paid off half of
this, and having been unable to do more, had been
arrested eighteen months before. The third had
similarly received $80 for a promise to pay $160;
he had been in prison five years and three months.<a name="page236" id="page236"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;236]</span>
Another had borrowed $100, and knew not the sum
which stood yet against him. Another had been in
prison five years for a debt alleged to have been
contracted by an uncle long dead. Another had
borrowed $50 on a bond for $100. Another had
languished eighteen months in gaol on a claim for
$120; the amount originally advanced to him was
about $30, but the acknowledgment was for $60,
which had been renewed for $120 on its falling due
and being dishonoured. Another had borrowed $15
on agreeing to refund $30, which was afterwards
increased to $60 and then to $105. He has been
imprisoned three years. The debt of another,
originally $16 for a loan of half that amount, has
since been doubled twice, and now stands at $64,
less $17 paid on account, while for forty-two
measures of wheat delivered on account he can get
no allowance, though that was three years ago, and
four months afterwards he was sent to prison.
Another had paid off the $50 he owed for an
advance of $25, but on some claim for expenses the
creditor had withheld the bond, and is now suing
for the whole amount again. He has been in
prison two years and six months. Another has paid
twenty measures of barley on account of a bond for
$100, for which he has received $50, and he was
imprisoned at the same time as the last speaker, his
debt being due to the same man. Another had
borrowed $90 on the usual terms, and has paid the
whole in cash or wheat, but cannot get back the
bond. He has previously been imprisoned for a
year, but two years after his release he was re-arrested,
fourteen months ago. Another has been two
months in gaol on a claim for $25 for a loan of $12.<a name="page237" id="page237"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;237]</span>
The last one has a bitter tale to tell, if any could
be worse than the wearisome similarity of those who
have preceded him.</p>
<p>
"Some years ago," he says, "I and my two
brothers, Drees and Ali, borrowed $200 from a
Jew of Mequinez, for which we gave him a notarial
bond for $400. We paid him a small sum on
account every month, as we could get it&mdash;a few
dollars at a time&mdash;besides presents of butter, fowls,
and eggs. At the end of the first year he threatened
to imprison us, and made us change the bond for
one for $800, and year by year he raised the debt
this way till it reached $3000, even after allowing
for what we had paid off. I saw no hope of ever
meeting his claim, so I ran away, and my brother
Drees was imprisoned for six years. He died last
winter, leaving a wife and three children, the
youngest, a daughter, being born a few months
after her father was taken away. He never saw
her. By strenuous efforts our family paid off the
$3000, selling all their land, and borrowing small
sums. But the Jew would not give up the bond.
He died about two years ago, and we do not know
who is claiming now, but we are told that the sum
demanded is $560. We have nothing now left to
sell, and, being in prison, we cannot work. When
my brother Drees died, I and my brother Ali were
seized to take his place. My kaïd was very sorry
for me, and became surety that I would not escape,
so that my irons were removed; but my brother
remains still in fetters, as poor Drees did all through
the six years. We have no hope of our friends
raising any money, so we must wait for death to
release us."</p>

<a name="page238" id="page238"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;238]</span>
<p>
Here he covers his face with his hands, and
several of his companions, in spite of their own dire
troubles, have to draw their shrivelled arms across
their eyes, as silence falls upon the group.</p>
<p>
As we turn away heartsick a more horrible
sight than any confronts us before the lieutenant-governor's
court. A man is suspended by the arms
and legs, face downwards, by a party of police, who
grasp his writhing limbs. With leather thongs a
stalwart policeman on either side is striking his
bare back in turn. Already blood is flowing freely,
but the victim does not shriek. He only winces
and groans, or gives an almost involuntary cry as
the cruel blows fall on some previously harrowed
spot. He is already unable to move his limbs, but
the blows fall thick and fast. Will they never cease?</p>
<p>
By the side stands a young European counting
them one by one, and when the strikers slow down
from exhaustion he orders them to stop, that others
may relieve them. The victim is by this time
swooning, so the European directs that he shall be
put on the ground and deluged with water till he
revives. When sufficiently restored the count
begins again. Presently the European stays them
a second time; the man is once again insensible,
yet he has only received six hundred lashes of the
thousand which have been ordered.</p>
<p>
"Well," he exclaims, "it's no use going on with
him to-day. Put him in the gaol now, and I'll
come and see him have the rest to-morrow."</p>
<p>
"God bless thee, but surely he has had enough!"
exclaims the lieutenant-governor, in sympathetic
tones.</p>
<p>
"Enough? He deserves double! The consul<a name="page239" id="page239"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;239]</span>
has only ordered a thousand, and I am here to see
that he has every one. We'll teach these villains
to rob our houses!"</p>
<p>
"There is neither force nor power save in
God, the High, the Mighty! As thou sayest; it is
written," and the powerless official turns away disgusted.
"God burn these Nazarenes, their wives
and families, and all their ancestors! They were
never fit for aught but hell!" he may be heard
muttering as he enters his house, and well may he
feel as he does.</p>
<p>
The policemen carry the victim off to the gaol
hard by, depositing him on the ground, after once
more restoring him with cold water.</p>
<p>
"God burn their fathers and their grandfathers,
and the whole cursed race of them!" they murmur,
for their thoughts still run upon the consul and the
clerk.</p>
<p>
Leaving him sorrowfully, they return to the
yard, where we still wait to obtain some information
as to the cause of such treatment.</p>
<p>
"Why, that dog of a Nazarene, the Greek
consul, says that his house was robbed a month
ago, though we don't believe him, for it wasn't
worth it. The sinner says that a thousand dollars
were stolen, and he has sent in a claim for it to the
Sultan. The minister's now at court for the money,
the Satan! God rid our country of them all!"</p>
<p>
"But how does this poor fellow come in for it?"</p>
<p>
"He! He never touched the money! Only
he had some quarrel with the clerk, so they accused
him of the theft, as he was the native living nearest
to the house, just over the fence. He's nothing
but a poor donkey-man, and an honest one at that.<a name="page240" id="page240"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;240]</span>
The consul sent his clerk up here to say he was
the thief, and that he must receive a thousand
lashes. The governor refused till the man should
be tried and convicted, but the Greek wouldn't hear
of it, and said that if he wasn't punished at once he
would send a courier to his minister at Marrákesh,
and have a complaint made to the Sultan. The
governor knew that if he escaped it would most
likely cost him his post to fight the consul, so he
gave instructions for the order to be carried out,
and went indoors so as not to be present."</p>
<p>
"God is supreme!" ejaculates a bystander.</p>
<p>
"But these infidels of Nazarenes know nothing
of Him. His curse be on them!" answers the
policeman. "They made us ride the poor man
round the town on a bare-backed donkey, with his
face to the tail, and all the way two of us had to
thrash him, crying, 'Thus shall be done to the man
who robs a consul!' He was ready to faint before
we got him up here. God knows <i>we</i> don't want to
lash him again!"</p>

<br /><hr class="short" /><br />
<p>
Next day as we pass the gaol we stop to inquire
after the prisoner, but the poor fellow is still too
weak to receive the balance due, and so it is for
several days. Then they tell us that he has been
freed from them by God, who has summoned his
spirit, though meanwhile the kindly attentions of a
doctor have been secured, and everything possible
under the circumstances has been done to relieve
his sufferings.  After all, he was "only a Moor!"</p>

<br /><hr class="short" /><br />

<a name="page241" id="page241"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;241]</span>
<p>
The Greek consul reported that the condition
of the Moorish prisons was a disgrace to the age,
and that he had himself known prisoners who had
succumbed to their evil state after receiving a few
strokes from the lash.</p>
<p>
A statement of claim for a thousand dollars,
alleged to have been robbed from his house, was
forwarded by courier to his chief, then at Court,
and was promptly added to the demands that it
was part of His Excellency's errand to enforce.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="XXVI1" id="XXVI1"></a>
<a href="#XXVI1r">*</a> All these statements were taken down from the lips of the victims
at the prison door, and most, if not all of them, were supported by
documentary evidence.</p>

Crouched at the foreigner's feet lay what appeared
but a bundle of rags, in reality a suppliant Moor,
once a man of wealth and position. Hugging a pot
of butter brought as an offering, clutching convulsively
at the leg of the chair, his furrowed face
bespoke past suffering and present earnestness.</p>
<p>
"God bless thee, Bashador, and all the Christians,
and give me grace in thy sight!"</p>

"Oh, indeed, so you like the Christians?"</p>

"Oh yes, I am, I am a háj (pilgrim to Mekka),

"Trouble enough," replies the Moor, with a<a name="page243" id="page243"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;243]</span>
sigh. "I am Hamed Zirári. I was rich once, and
powerful in my tribe, but now I have only this

with our children in a nuállah (hut), but after all we
are happier now when they leave us alone, than
when we were rich. I have plenty of land left, it
is true, but we dare not for our lives cultivate more

than six hundred cows and bullocks, more than
twelve hundred sheep, a hundred good camels,
fifty mules, twenty horses, and twenty-four mares.
I had also four wives and many slaves. I had
plenty of guns and abundance of grain in my
stores; in fact, I was rich and powerful among my
people, by whom I was held in great honour; but
alas! alas! our new kaïd is worse than the old
one; he is insatiable, a pit without a bottom!
There is no possibility of satisfying his greed!</p>
<p>
"I felt that although by continually making him
valuable presents I succeeded in keeping on friendly
terms with him, he was always coveting my wealth.
We have in our district two markets a week, and at
last I had to present him with from $50 to $80
every market-day. I was nevertheless in constant
dread of his eyes&mdash;they are such greedy eyes&mdash;and
I saw that it would be necessary to look out for<a name="page244" id="page244"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;244]</span>
protection. I was too loyal a subject of the Sultan
then, and too good a Muslim, to think of Nazarene
protection, so I applied for help to Si Mohammed
boo Aálam, commander-in-chief of our lord (whom
may God send victorious), and to enter the Sultan's
service.</p>
<p>
"We prepared a grand present with which to
approach him, and when it was ready I started with
it, accompanied by two of my cousins. We took
four splendid horses, four mares with their foals,
four she-camels with their young, four picked cows,
two pairs of our best bullocks, four fine young male
slaves, each with a silver-mounted gun, and four
well-dressed female slaves, each carrying a new
bucket in her hand, many jars containing fresh and
salted butter and honey, beside other things, and a
thousand dollars in cash. It was a fine present,
was it not, Bashador?</p>
<p>
"Well, on arrival at Si Mohammed's place, we
slaughtered two bullocks at his door, and humbly
begged his gracious acceptance of our offering,
which we told him we regretted was not greater,
but that as we were his brethren, we trusted to find
favour in his sight. We said we wished to honour
him, and to become his fortunate slaves, whose chief
delight it would be to do his bidding. We reminded
him that although he was so rich and powerful he
was still our brother, and that we desired nothing
better than to live in continual friendship with him.</p>
<p>
"He received and feasted us very kindly, and
gave us appointments as mounted guards to the
marshal of the Sultan, as which we served happily
for seven months. We were already thinking about
sending for some of our family to come and relieve<a name="page245" id="page245"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;245]</span>
us, that we might return home ourselves, when one
day Si Mohammed sent for us to say that he was
going away for a time, having received commands
from the Sultan to visit a distant tribe with the
effects of Royal displeasure. After mutual compliments
and blessings he set off with his soldiers.</p>
<p>
"Five days later a party of soldiers came to our
house. To our utter astonishment and dismay,
without a word of explanation, they put chains on
our necks and wrists, and placing us on mules,
bore us away. Remonstrance and resistance were
equally vain. We were in Mequinez. It was
already night, and though the gates were shut, and
are never opened again except in obedience to high
authority, they were silently opened for us to pass
through. Once outside, our eyes were bandaged,
and we were lashed to our uncomfortable seats.
Thus we travelled on as rapidly as possible, in
silence all night long. It was a long night, that,
indeed, Bashador, a weary night, but we felt sure
some worse fate awaited us; what, we could not
imagine, for we had committed no crime. Finally,
after three days we halted, and the bandages were
removed from our eyes. We found ourselves in a
market-place in Rahámna, within the jurisdiction of
our cursëd kaïd. All around us were our flocks and
herds, camels, and horses, all our movable property,
which we soon learnt had been brought there
for public sale. A great gathering was there to
purchase.</p>
<p>
"The kaïd was there, and when he saw us he
exclaimed, 'There you are, are you? You can't
escape from me now, you children of dogs!' Then
he turned to a brutal policeman, crying, 'Put the<a name="page246" id="page246"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;246]</span>
bastards on the ground, and give them a thousand
lashes.' Those words ring in my ears still. I felt
as in a dream. I was too utterly in his power to
think of answering, and after a very few strokes the
power of doing so was taken from me, for I lost
consciousness. How many blows we received I
know not, but we must have been very nearly
killed. When I revived we were in a filthy matmorah,
where we existed for seven months in
misery, being kept alive on a scanty supply of
barley loaves and water. At last I pretended to
have lost my reason, as I should have done in truth
had I stayed there much longer. When they told
the kaïd this, he gave permission for me to be let
out. I found my wife and children still living,
thank God, though they had had very hard times.
What has become of my cousins I do not know,
and do not dare to ask, but thou couldst, O Bashador,
if once I were under thy protection.</p>
<p>
"All I know is that, after receiving our present,
Si Mohammed sold us to the kaïd for twelve
hundred dollars. He was a fool, Bashador, a great
fool; had he demanded of us we would have given
him twelve hundred dollars to save ourselves what
we have had to suffer.</p>
<p>
"Wonderest thou still, O Bashador, that I prefer
the Nazarenes, and wish there were more of them
in the country? I respect the dust off their shoes
more than a whole nation of miscalled Muslims who
could treat me as I have been treated; but God is
just, and 'there is neither force nor power save in
God,' yes, 'all is written.' He gives to men according
to their hearts. We had bad hearts, and he
gave us a Government like them."</p>

<h4>II. THE SEARCH</h4>
<p>
The day was already far spent when at last Abd
Allah led his animal into one of the caravansarais
outside the gate of Mazagan, so, after saying his
evening prayers and eating his evening meal, he
lay down to rest on a heap of straw in one of the
little rooms of the fandak, undisturbed either by
anxious dreams, or by the multitude of lively
creatures about him.</p>
<p>
Ere the sun had risen the voice of the muédhdhin
awoke him with the call to early prayer. Shrill and
clear the notes rang out on the calm morning air in
that perfect silence&mdash;</p>
<p>
"G-o-d is gr-ea&mdash;t! G-o-d is gr-ea&mdash;t! G-o-d
is grea&mdash;t! I witness that there is no God but
God, and Mohammed is the messenger of God.
Come to prayer! Come to prayer! Come to prayer!
Prayer is better than sleep! Come to prayer!"</p>
<p>
Quickly rising, Abd Allah repaired to the water-tap,
and seating himself on the stone seat before it,
rapidly performed the prescribed religious ablutions,
this member three times, then the other as often,
and so on, all in order, right first, left to follow as
less honourable, finishing up with the pious ejaculation,
"God greatest!" Thence to the mosque
was but a step, and in a few minutes he stood barefooted
in those dimly-lighted, vaulted aisles, in which
the glimmering oil lamps and the early streaks of
daylight struggled for the mastery. His shoes
were on the ground before him at the foot of the
pillar behind which he had placed himself, and his
hands were raised before his face in the attitude of
prayer. Then, at the long-drawn cry of the leader,<a name="page248" id="page248"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;248]</span>
in company with his fellow-worshippers, he bowed
himself, and again with them rose once more, in
a moment to kneel down and bow his forehead to
the earth in humble adoration.</p>
<p>
Having performed the usual series of prayers,
he was ready for coffee and bread. This he took
at the door of the fandak, seated on the ground by
the coffee-stall, inquiring meanwhile the prospects
of protection in Mazagan.</p>
<p>
There was Tájir<a name="XXVII2r" id="XXVII2r"></a><a href="#XXVII2"><sup>*</sup></a> Pépé, always ready to appoint
a new agent for a consideration, but then he bore
almost as bad a name for tyrannizing over his
<i>protégés</i> as did the kaïds themselves. There was
Tájir Yûsef the Jew, but then he asked such tremendous
prices, because he was a vice-consul. There
was Tájir Juan, but then he was not on good enough
terms with his consul to protect efficiently those
whom he appointed, so he could not be thought of
either. But there was Tájir Vecchio, a new man
from Gibraltar, fast friends with his minister,
and who must therefore be strong, yet a man
who did not name too high a figure. To him,
therefore, Abd Allah determined to apply, and
when his store was opened presented himself.</p>
<p>
Under his cloak he carried three pots of butter
in one hand, and as many of honey in the other,
while a ragged urchin tramped behind with half a
dozen fowls tied in a bunch by the legs, and a
basket of eggs. The first thing was to get a word
with the head-man at the store; so, slipping a few
of the eggs into his hands, Abd Allah requested
an interview with the Tájir, with whom he had
come to make friends. This being promised, he<a name="page249" id="page249"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;249]</span>
squatted on his heels by the door, where he was
left to wait an hour or two, remarking to himself at
intervals that God was great, till summoned by one
of the servants to enter.</p>
<p>
The merchant was seated behind his desk, and
Abd Allah, having deposited his burden on the
floor, was making round the table to throw himself
at his feet, when he was stopped and allowed but
to kiss his hand.</p>
<p>
"Well, what dost thou want?"</p>
<p>
"I have come to make friends, O Merchant."</p>
<p>
"Who art thou?"</p>
<p>
"I am Abd Allah bin Boo Shaïb es-Sálih, O
Merchant, of Aïn Haloo in Rahámna. I have a
family there, and cattle, and very much land. I
wish to place all in thy hands, and to become thy
friend," again endeavouring to throw himself at the
feet of the European.</p>
<p>
"All right, all right, that will do. I will see
about it; come to me again to-morrow."</p>
<p>
"May God bless thee, O Merchant, and fill
thee with prosperity, and may He prolong thy
days in peace!"</p>
<p>
As Tájir Vecchio went on with his writing, Abd
Allah made off with a hopeful heart to spend the
next twenty-four anxious hours in the fandak, while
his offerings were carried away to the private house
by a servant.</p>
<p>
Next morning saw him there again, when much
the same scene was repeated. This time, however,
they got to business.</p>
<p>
"How can I befriend you?" asked the European,
after yesterday's conversation had been practically
repeated.</p>

<a name="page250" id="page250"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;250]</span>
<p>
"Thou canst very greatly befriend me by
making me thy agent in Aïn Haloo. I will work
for thee, and bring thee of the produce of my land
as others do, if I may only enjoy thy protection.
May God have mercy on thee, O Merchant. I
take refuge with thee."</p>
<p>
"I can't be always appointing agents and protecting
people for nothing. What can you give
me?"</p>
<p>
"Whatever is just, O Merchant, but the Lord
knows that I am not rich, though He has bestowed
sufficient on me to live, praise be to Him."</p>
<p>
"Well, I should want two hundred dollars down,
and something when the certificate is renewed next
year, besides which you would of course report
yourself each quarter, and not come empty-handed.
Animals and corn I can do best with, but I don't
want any of your poultry."</p>
<p>
"God bless thee, Merchant, and make thee
prosperous, but two hundred dollars is a heavy sum
for me, and this last harvest has not been so
plentiful as the one before, as thou knowest. Grant
me this protection for one hundred and fifty dollars,
and I can manage it, but do not make it an
impossibility."</p>
<p>
"I can't go any lower: there are scores of
Moors who would give me that price. Do as you
like. Good morning."</p>
<p>
"Thou knowest, O Merchant, I could not give
more than I have offered," replied Abd Allah as
he rose and left the place.</p>
<p>
But as no one else could be found in the town
to protect him on better terms, he had at last to
return, and in exchange for the sum demanded<a name="page251" id="page251"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;251]</span>
received a paper inscribed on one side in Arabic,
and on the other in English, as follows:&mdash;</p><br />

<h3>XXVIII</h3>

<h2>JUSTICE FOR THE JEW</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Sleep on anger, and thou wilt not rise repentant."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
The kaïd sat in his seat of office, or one might
rather say reclined, for Moorish officials have a
habit of lying in two ways at once when they are
supposed to be doing justice. Strictly speaking, his
position was a sort of halfway one, his back being
raised by a pile of cushions, with his right leg drawn
up before him, as he leant on his left elbow. His
judgement seat was a veritable wool-sack, or rather
mattress, placed across the left end of a long narrow
room, some eight feet by twenty, with a big door in
the centre of one side. The only other apertures in
the whitewashed but dirty walls were a number of
ventilating loop-holes, splayed on the inside, ten
feet out of the twelve above the floor. This was
of worn octagonal tiles, in parts covered with a
yellow rush mat in an advanced state of consumption.
Notwithstanding the fact that the ceiling was of
some dark colour, hard to be defined at its present
age, the audience-chamber was amply lighted from
the lofty horse-shoe archway of the entrance, for
sunshine is reflection in Morocco to a degree unknown
in northern climes.</p>
<p>
On the wall above the head of the kaïd hung a<a name="page253" id="page253"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;253]</span>
couple of huge and antiquated horse-pistols, while
on a small round table at his feet, some six inches
high, lay a collection of cartridges and gunsmith's
tools. Behind him, on a rack, were half a dozen
long flint-lock muskets, and on the wall by his feet
a number of Moorish daggers and swords. In his
hand the governor fondled a European revolver,
poking out and replacing the charges occasionally,
just to show that it was loaded.</p>
<p>
His personal attire, though rich in quality, ill
became his gawky figure, and there was that about
his badly folded turban which bespoke the parvenu.
Like the muzzle of some wolf, his pock-marked
visage glowered on a couple of prostrated litigants
before him, as they fiercely strove to prove each
other wrong. Near his feet was squatted his private
secretary, and at the door stood policemen awaiting
instructions to imprison one or both of the contending
parties. The dispute was over the straying of
some cattle, a paltry claim for damages. The
plaintiff having presented the kaïd with a loaf of
sugar and a pound of candles, was in a fair way to
win his case, when a suggestive sign on the part of
the defendant, comprehended by the judge as a
promise of a greater bribe, somewhat upset his calculations,
for he was summarily fined a couple of
dollars, and ordered to pay another half dollar costs
for having allowed the gate of his garden to stand
open, thereby inviting his neighbour's cattle to enter.
Without a word he was carried off to gaol pending
payment, while the defendant settled with the judge
and left the court.</p>
<p>
Into the midst of this scene came another policeman,
gripping by the arm a poor Jewish seamstress<a name="page254" id="page254"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;254]</span>
named Mesaôdah, who had had the temerity to use
insulting language to her captor when that functionary
was upbraiding her for not having completed some
garment when ordered, though he insisted on paying
only half-price, declaring that it was for the governor.
The Jewess had hardly spoken when she lay sprawling
on the ground from a blow which she dare not,
under any provocation, return, but her temper had
so far gained the mastery over her, that as she rose
she cursed her tormentor roundly. That was enough;
without more ado the man had laid his powerful
arm upon her, and was dragging her to his master's
presence, knowing how welcome any such case
would be, even though it was not one out of which
he might hope to make money.</p>
<p>
Reckless of the governor's well-known character,
Mesaôdah at once opened her mouth to complain
against Mahmood, pitching her voice in the terrible
key of her kind.</p>
<p>
"My Lord, may God bless thee and lengthen...."</p>
<p>
A fierce shake from her captor interrupted the
sentence, but did not keep her quiet, for immediately
she continued, in pleading tones, as best she could,
struggling the while to keep her mouth free from
the wretch's hand.</p>
<p>
"Protect me, I pray thee, from this cruel man;
he has struck me: yes, my Lord."</p>
<p>
"Strike her again if she doesn't stop that noise,"
cried the kaïd, and as the man raised his hand to
threaten her she saw there was no hope, and her
legs giving way beneath her, she sank to the ground
in tears.</p>
<p>
"For God's sake, yes, my Lord, have mercy on
thine handmaid." It was pitiful to hear the altered<a name="page255" id="page255"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;255]</span>
tones, and it needed the heart of a brute to reply as
did the governor, unmoved, by harshly asking what
she had been up to.</p>
<p>
"She's a thief, my Lord, a liar, like all her people;
God burn their religion; I gave her a waistcoat to
make a week ago, and I purposed it for a present
to thee, my Lord, but she has made away with the
stuff, and when I went for it she abused me, and,
by thy leave, thee also, my Lord; here she is to be
punished."</p>
<p>
"It's a lie, my Lord; the stuff is in my hut, and
the waistcoat's half done, but I knew I should never
get paid for it, so had to get some other work done
to keep my children from starving, for I am a widow.
Have mercy on me!"</p>
<p>
"God curse the liar!  I have spoken the truth,"
broke in the policeman.</p>
<p>
"Fetch a basket for her!" ordered the kaïd, and
in another moment a second attendant was assisting
Mahmood to force the struggling woman to sit in a
large and pliable basket of palmetto, the handles of
which were quickly lashed across her stomach. She
was then thrown shrieking on her back, her bare
legs lifted high, and tied to a short piece of pole
just in front of the ankles; one man seized each
end of this, a third awaiting the governor's orders
to strike the soles.  In his hand he had a short-handled
lash made of twisted thongs from Tafilált,
well soaked in water. The efforts of the victim to
attack the men on either side becoming violent, a
delay was caused by having to tie her hands together,
her loud shrieks rending the air the while.</p>
<p>
"Give her a hundred," said the kaïd, beginning
to count as the blows descended, giving fresh edge<a name="page256" id="page256"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;256]</span>
to the piercing yells, interspersed with piteous cries
for mercy, and ribbing the skin in long red lines,
which were soon lost in one raw mass of bleeding
flesh. As the arm of one wearied, another took his
place, and a bucket of cold water was thrown over
the victim's legs. At first her face had been ashy
pale, it was now livid from the blood descending to
it, as her legs grew white all but the soles, which
were already turning purple under the cruel lash.
Then merciful unconsciousness stepped in, and
silence supervened.</p>
<p>
"That will do," said the governor, having counted
eighty-nine. "Take her away; she'll know better
next time!" and he proceeded with the cases before
him, fining this one, imprisoning that, and bastinadoing
a third, with as little concern as an English
registrar would sign an order to pay a guinea fine.
Indeed, why should he do otherwise. This was his
regular morning's work. It was a month before
Mesaôdah could touch the ground with her feet,
and more than three before she could totter along
with two sticks. Her children were kept alive by
her neighbours till she could sit up and "stitch,
stitch, stitch," but there was no one to hear her
bitter complaint, and no one to dry her tears.</p>
<p>
One day his faithful henchman dragged before
the kaïd a Jewish broker, whose crime of having
bid against that functionary on the market, when
purchasing supplies for his master, had to be expiated
by a fine of twenty dollars, or a hundred
lashes. The misguided wretch chose the latter,
loving his coins too well; but after the first half-dozen
had descended on his naked soles, he cried
for mercy and agreed to pay.</p>

<a name="page257" id="page257"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;257]</span>
<p>
Another day it was a more wealthy member of
the community who was summoned on a serious
charge. The kaïd produced a letter addressed to
the prisoner, which he said had been intercepted,
couched in the woefully corrupted Arabic of the
Moorish Jews, but in the cursive Hebrew character.</p>
<p>
"Canst read, O Moses?" asked the kaïd, in a
surly tone.</p>
<p>
"Certainly, yes, my Lord, may God protect thee,
when the writing is in the sacred script."</p>
<p>
"Read that aloud, then," handing him the
missive.</p>
<p>
Moses commenced by rapidly glancing his eye
down the page, and as he did so his face grew pale,
his hand shook, and he muttered something in the
Hebrew tongue as the kaïd sharply ordered him to
proceed.</p>
<p>
"My Lord, yes, my Lord; it is false, it is a fraud,"
he stammered.</p>
<p>
"The Devil take thee, thou son of a dog;
read what is set before thee, and let us have none
of thy impudence. The gaol is handy."</p>
<p>
With a trembling voice Moses the usurer read
the letter, purporting to have been written by an
intimate friend in Mogador, and implying by its
contents that Moses had, when in that town some
years ago, embraced the faith of Islám, from which
he was therefore now a pervert, and consequently
under pain of death. He was already crouched
upon the ground, as is the custom before a great
man, but as he spelled out slowly the damnatory
words, he had to stretch forth his hands to keep
from falling over. He knew that there was nothing
to be gained by denial, by assurances that the letter<a name="page258" id="page258"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;258]</span>
was a forgery; the kaïd's manner indicated plainly
enough that <i>he</i> meant to be satisfied with it, and
there was no appeal.</p>
<p>
"Moses," said the kaïd, in a mock confidential
tone, as he took back the letter, "thou'rt in my
power. All that thou hast is mine. With such
evidence against thee as this thy very head is in my
hands. If thou art wise, and wilt share thy fortune
with me, all shall go well; if not, thou knowest what
to expect. I am to-day in need of a hundred dollars.
Now go!"</p>
<p>
An hour had not elapsed before, with a heart
still heavier than the bag he carried, Moses crossed
the courtyard again, and deposited the sum required
in the hands of the kaïd, with fresh assurances of
his innocence, imploring the destruction of that fatal
document, which was readily promised, though with
no intention of complying with the request, notwithstanding
that to procure another as that had been
procured would cost but a trifle.</p>
<p>
These are only instances which could be multiplied
of how the Jews of Morocco suffer at the
hands of brutal officials. As metal which attracts
the electricity from a thunder-cloud, so they invariably
suffer first when a newly appointed, conscienceless
governor comes to rule.</p>
<p>
With all his faults the previous kaïd had recognized
how closely bound up with that of the
Moors under his jurisdiction was the welfare of
Jews similarly situated, so that, favoured by his
wise administration, their numbers and their wealth
had increased till, though in outward appearance
beggarly, they formed an important section of the
community. The new kaïd, however, saw in them<a name="page259" id="page259"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;259]</span>
but a possible mine, a goose that laid golden eggs,
so, like the fool of the story, he set about destroying
it when the supply of eggs fell off, for there was of
necessity a limit to the repeated offerings which, on
one pretext or another, he extorted from these
luckless "tributaries," as they are described in
Moorish legal documents.</p>
<p>
When he found that ordinary means of persuasion
failed, he had resort to more drastic
measures. He could not imagine fresh feasts and
public occasions, auspicious or otherwise, on which to
collect "presents" from them, so he satisfied himself
by bringing specious charges against the more
wealthy Jews and fining them, as well as by encouraging
Moors to accuse them in various ways.
Many of the payments to the governor being in
small and mutilated coin, every Friday he sent to
the Jews what he had received during the week,
demanding a round sum in Spanish dollars, far
more than their fair value. Then when he had
forced upon them a considerable quantity of this
depreciated stuff, he would send a crier round
notifying the public that it was out of circulation
and no longer legal tender, moreover giving warning
that the "Jew's money" was not to be trusted,
as it was known that they had counterfeit coins in
their possession. It was then time to offer them half
price for it, which they had no option but to accept,
though some while later he would re-issue it at its
full value, and having permitted its circulation, would
force it upon them again.</p>
<p>
The repairs which it was found necessary to
effect in the kasbah, the equipment of troops, the
contributions to the expenses of the Sultan's<a name="page260" id="page260"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;260]</span>
expeditions, or the payment of indemnities to foreign
nations, were constantly recurring pretexts for levying
fresh sums from the Jews as well as from
the Moors, and these were the legal ones. The
illegal were too harrowing for description. Young
children and old men were brutally thrashed and
then imprisoned till they or their friends paid heavy
ransoms, and even the women occasionally suffered
in this way. On Sabbaths and fast days orders
would be issued to the Jews, irrespective of age or
rank, to perform heavy work for the governor,
perhaps to drag some heavy load or block of stone.
Those who could buy themselves off were fortunate:
those who could not do so were harnessed and
driven like cattle under the lashes of yard-long
whips, being compelled when their work was done
to pay their taskmasters. Indeed, it was Egypt
over again, but there was no Moses. Men or
women found with shoes on were bastinadoed
and heavily fined, and on more than one occasion
the sons of the best-off Israelites were arrested in
school on the charge of having used disrespectful
language regarding the Sultan, and thrown into
prison chained head and feet, in such a manner that
it was impossible to stretch their bodies. Thus
they were left for days without food, all but dead,
in spite of the desire of their relatives to support
them, till ransoms of two hundred dollars apiece
could be raised to obtain their release, in some cases
three months after their incarceration.</p>

<h2>CIVIL WAR IN MOROCCO</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Wound of speech is worse than wound of sword."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Spies were already afield when the sun rose this
morning, and while their return with the required
information was eagerly expected, those of Asni
who would be warriors took a hasty breakfast and
looked to their horses and guns.</p>
<p>
Directly intelligence as to the whereabouts of
the Aït Mîzán arrived, the cavalcade set forth, perforce
in Indian file, on account of the narrow single
track, but wherever it was possible those behind
pressed forward and passed their comrades in their
eagerness to reach the scene of action. No idea of
order or military display crossed their minds, and
but for the skirmishers who scoured the country
round as they advanced, it would have been easy
for a concealed foe to have picked them off one by
one. Nevertheless they made a gallant show in the
morning sun, which glinted on their ornamented
stirrups and their flint-locks, held like lances, with
the butts upon the pummels before them. The
varied colours of their trappings, though old and
worn, looked gay by the side of the red cloth-covered
saddles and the gun-cases of similar
material used by many as turbans. But for the<a name="page262" id="page262"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;262]</span>
serious expression on the faces of the majority, and
the eager scanning of each knoll and shrub, the
party might have been intent on powder-play instead
of powder-business.</p>
<p>
For a mile or two no sign of human being was
seen, and the ride was already growing wearisome
when a sudden report on their right was followed
by the heavy fall of one of their number, his well-trained
horse standing still for him to re-mount,
though he would never more do so. Nothing but a
puff of smoke showed whence the shot had come,
some way up the face of a hill. The first impulse
was to make a charge in that direction, and to fire a
volley; but the experience of the leader reminded
him that if there were only one man there it would
not be worth while, and if there were more they
might fall into an ambush. So their file passed on
while the scouts rode towards the hill slope. A
few moments later one of these had his horse shot
under him, and then a volley was fired which took
little effect on the advancing horsemen, still too far
away for successful aim.</p>
<p>
They had been carefully skirting a wooded
patch which might give shelter to their foes, whom
they soon discovered to be lying in trenches behind
the first hill-crests. Unless they were dislodged, it
would be almost impossible to proceed, so, making a
rapid flank movement, the Asni party spurred their
horses and galloped round to gain the hills above
the hidden enemy. As they did so random shots
were discharged, and when they approached the
level of the trenches, they commenced a series of
rushes forward, till they came within range. In
doing so they followed zig-zag routes to baffle aim,<a name="page263" id="page263"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;263]</span>
firing directly they made out the whereabouts of
their assailants, and beating a hasty retreat. What
success they were achieving they could not tell, but
their own losses were not heavy.</p>
<p>
Soon, as their firing increased, that from the
trenches which they were gradually approaching
grew less, and fresh shots from behind awoke them
to the fact that the enemy was making a rear
attack. By this time they were in great disorder,
scattered over a wide area; the majority had gained
the slight cover of the brushwood to their rear, and
a wide space separated them from the new arrivals,
who were performing towards them the same wild
rushes that they themselves had made towards the
trenches. They were therefore divided roughly
into two divisions, the footmen in the shelter of the
shrubs, the horsemen engaging the mounted enemy.</p>
<p>
Among the brushwood hardly was the figure
of friend or foe discernible, for all lay down
behind any available shelter, crawling from point to
point like so many caterpillars, but firing quickly
enough when an enemy was sighted. This style of
warfare has its advantages, for it greatly diminishes
losses on either side. For the horsemen, deprived
of such shelter, safety lay in rapid movements and
unexpected evolutions, each man acting for himself,
and keeping as far away from his comrades as
possible. So easily were captures made that it
almost seemed as if many preferred surrender and
safety to the chances of war, for they knew that
they were sure of honourable treatment on both
sides. The prisoners were not even bound, but
merely disarmed and marched to the rear, to be
conveyed at night in a peaceful manner to their<a name="page264" id="page264"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;264]</span>
captors' tents and huts, there to be treated as guests
till peace should result in exchange.</p>
<p>
By this time the combatants were scattered over
a square mile or so, and though the horsemen of
Asni had driven the Aït Mîzán from the foremost
trenches by the bold rushes described, and their
footmen had engaged them, no further advantage
seemed likely to accrue, while they were terribly
harassed by those who still remained under cover.
The signal was therefore given for a preconcerted
retreat, which at once began. Loud shouts of an
expected victory now arose from the Aït Mîzán,
who were gradually drawn from their hiding-places
by their desire to secure nearer shots at the men
of Asni as they slowly descended the hill.</p>
<p>
At length the Aït Mîzán began to draw somewhat
to one side, as they discovered that they were
being led too far into the open, but this movement
was outwitted by the Asni horsemen, who
were now pouring down on the scene. The
wildest confusion supervened; many fell on every
hand. Victory was now assured to Asni, which the
enemy were quick to recognize, and as the sun was
by this time at blazing noon, and energy grew
slack on both sides, none was loth to call a conference.
This resulted in an agreement by the vanquished
to return the stolen cattle which had
formed the <i>casus belli</i>, for indeed they were no
longer able to protect them from their real owners.
As many more were forfeited by way of damages,
and messages were despatched to the women left in
charge to hand them over to a party of the victors.
Prisoners were meantime exchanged, while through
the medium of the local "holy man" a peace was<a name="page265" id="page265"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;265]</span>
formally ratified, after which each party returned
to its dead, who were quickly consigned to their
shallow graves.</p>
<p>
Such of the Asni men as were not mourners,
now assembled in the open space of their village to
be feasted by their women as victors. Basins, some
two feet across, were placed on the ground filled
with steaming kesk'soo. Round each of these portions
sat cross-legged some eight or ten of the men,
and a metal bowl of water was handed from one to
the other to rinse the fingers of the right hand.
They sat upon rude blankets spread on mats, the
scene lit by Roman-like olive-oil lamps, and a few
French candles round the board of the sheïkh and
allied leaders.</p>
<p>
A striking picture, indeed, they presented, there
in the still night air, thousands of heaven-lights
gleaming from the dark blue vault above, outrivalling
the flicker of those simple earth-flames on
their lined and sun-burnt faces. The women who
waited on them, all of middle age, alone remained
erect, as they glided about on their bare feet, carrying
bowl and towel from man to man. From the
huts and the tents around came many strange
sounds of bird, beast, and baby, for the cocks were
already crowing, as it was growing late,<a name="XXIX1r" id="XXIX1r"></a><a href="#XXIX1"><sup>*</sup></a> while the
dogs bayed at the shadow of the cactus and the
weird shriek of the night-bird.</p>
<p>
"B'ism Illah!" exclaimed the host at each basin
("In the Name of God!")&mdash;as he would ask a blessing&mdash;when
he finished breaking bread for his circle,
and plunged his first sop in the gravy. "B'ism Illah!"
they all replied, and followed suit in a startlingly<a name="page266" id="page266"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;266]</span>
sudden silence wherein naught but the stowing
away of food could be heard, till one of them burnt
his fingers by an injudiciously deep dive into the
centre after a toothsome morsel.</p>
<p>
In the midst of a sea of broth rose mountains
of steamed and buttered kesk'soo, in the craters
of which had been placed the contents of the
stew-pot, the disjointed bones of chickens with
onions and abundant broad beans. The gravy was
eaten daintily with sops of bread, conveyed to the
mouth in a masterly manner without spilling a drop,
while the kesk'soo was moulded in the palm of
the right hand into convenient sized balls and
shot into the mouth by the thumb. The meat
was divided with the thumb and fingers of the right
hand alone, since the left may touch no food.</p>
<p>
At last one by one sat back, his greasy hand
outstretched, and after taking a sip of cold water
from the common jug with his left, and licking his
right to prevent the waste of one precious grain,
each washed his hands, rinsed his mouth thrice,
polished his teeth with his right forefinger, and felt
ready to begin again, all agreeing that "he who is not
first at the powder, should not be last at the dish."</p>

<h3>XXX</h3>

<h2>THE POLITICAL SITUATION</h2>

<p class="center1">
"A guess of the informed is better than the assurance of the ignorant."</p>
<p class="center1">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Ever since the accession of the present Sultan,
Mulai Abd el Azîz IV., on his attaining the age
of twenty in 1900, Morocco has been more than
ever the focus of foreign designs, both public and
private, which have brought about a much more
disturbed condition than under his father, or even
under the subsequent Wazeer Regent. The manifest
friendlessness of the youth, his lack of training
for so important a part, and the venality of his
entourage, at once attracted birds of prey, and they
have worked their will.</p>
<p>
Since the death of El Hasan III., in 1894, the
administration had been controlled by the former
Lord High Chamberlain, or "Curtain" of the
shareefian throne, whose rule was severe, though
good, and it seemed doubtful whether he would
relinquish the reins of authority. The other
wazeers whom his former master had left in office
had been imprisoned on various charges, and he
stood supreme. He was, however, old and enfeebled
by illness, so when in 1900 his end came instead of
his resignation, few were surprised. What they
were not quite prepared for, however, was the<a name="page268" id="page268"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;268]</span>
clearing of the board within a week or two by the
death of his two brothers and a cousin, whom he had
promoted to be respectively Commander-in-chief,
Chamberlain, and Master of the Ceremonies&mdash;all of
them, it was declared, by influenza. Another brother
had died but a short while before, and the commissioner
sent to Tangier to arrange matters with
the French was found dead in his room&mdash;from
asphyxia caused by burning charcoal. Thus was
the Cabinet dissolved, and the only remaining
member resigned. There then rose suddenly to
power a hitherto unheard of Arab of the South, El
Menébhi, who essayed too much in acting as Ambassador
to London while still Minister of War, and
returned to find his position undermined; he has
since emigrated to Egypt. It was freely asserted
that the depletion of the Moorish exchequer was
due to his peculation, resulting in his shipping a
large fortune to England in specie, with the assistance
of British officials who were supposed to have
received a handsome "consideration" in addition to
an enormous price paid for British protection. Thus,
amid a typically Moorish cloud, he left the scene.
From that time the Court has been the centre of kaleidoscopic
intrigues, which have seriously hampered
administration, but which were not in themselves
sufficient to disturb the country.</p>
<p>
What was of infinitely greater moment was the
eagerness with which the young ruler, urged by his
Circassian mother, sought advice and counsel from
Europe, and endeavoured to act up to it. One
disinterested and trusted friend at that juncture
would have meant the regeneration of the Empire,
provided that interference from outside were stayed.<a name="page269" id="page269"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;269]</span>
But this was not to be. The few impartial individuals
who had access to the Sultan were outnumbered
by the horde of politicians, diplomats,
adventurers, and schemers who surrounded him, the
latter at least freely bribing wazeers to obtain their
ends. In spite of an unquestionable desire to do
what was best for his country, and to act upon the
good among the proffered advice, wild extravagance
resulted both in action and expenditure.</p>
<p>
Thus Mulai Abd el Azîz became the laughing-stock
of Europe, and the butt of his people's scorn.
His heart was with the foreigners&mdash;with dancing
women and photographers,&mdash;he had been seen in
trousers, even on a bicycle! What might he not
do next? A man so implicated with unbelievers
could hardly be a faithful Muslim, said the discontented.
No more efficacious text could have been
found to rouse fanaticism and create dissatisfaction
throughout his dominions. Black looks accompanied
the mention of his name, and it was
whispered that the Leader of the Faithful was
selling himself and his Empire, if not to the Devil,
at least to the Nazarenes, which was just as bad.
Any other country would have been ripe for rebellion,
as Europe supposed that Morocco was, but
scattered and conflicting interests defeated all
attempts to induce a general rising.</p>
<p>
One of the wisest measures of the new reign
was the attempt to reorganize finances in accordance
with English advice, by the systematic levy of
taxes hitherto imposed in the arbitrary fashion
described in Chapter II. This was hailed with
delight, and had it been maintained by a strong
Government, would have worked wonders in<a name="page270" id="page270"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;270]</span>
restoring prosperity. But foreign <i>protégés</i> refused to
pay, and objections of all sorts were raised, till at
last the "terteeb," as it was called, became impossible
of collection without recourse to arms.
Fearing this, the money in hand to pay the tax
was expended on guns and cartridges, which the
increasing demand led foreigners to smuggle in by
the thousand.</p>
<p>
It is estimated that some millions of fire-arms&mdash;a
large proportion of them repeating rifles with a
large supply of ammunition&mdash;are now in the hands
of the people, while the Government has never been
worse supplied than at present. Ship-load after
ship-load has been landed on the coast in defiance
of all authority, and large consignments have been
introduced over the Algerian frontier, the state of
which has in consequence become more than ever
unsettled. In short, the benign intentions of Mulai
Abd el Azîz have been interpreted as weakness,
and once again the Nazarenes are accused&mdash;to
quote a recent remark of an Atlas scribe&mdash;of having
"spoiled the Sultan," and of being about to "spoil
the country."</p>
<p>
Active among the promoters of dissatisfaction
have been throughout the Idreesi Shareefs, representatives
of the original Muslim dynasty in
Morocco; venerated for their ancestry and adherence
to all that is retrogressive or bigoted, and on
principle opposed to the reigning dynasty. These
leaders of discontent find able allies in the Algerians
in Morocco, some of whom settled there years
ago because sharing their feelings and determined
not to submit to the French; but of whom others,
while expressing equal devotion to the old order,<a name="page271" id="page271"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;271]</span>
can from personal experience recommend the advantages
of French administration, to which even
their exiled brethren or their descendants no longer
feel equal objection.</p>
<p>
The summary punishment inflicted a few years
ago on the murderer of an Englishman in the
streets of Fez was, like everything else, persistently
misinterpreted through the country. In the distant
provinces the story&mdash;as reported by natives therefrom&mdash;ran
that the Nazarene had been shot by a
saint while attempting to enter and desecrate the
sacred shrine of Mulai Idrees, and that by executing
him the Sultan showed himself an Unbeliever.
When British engineers were employed to survey
the route for a railway between Fez and Mequinez
this was reported as indicating an absolute sale of
the country, and the people were again stirred up,
though not to actual strife.</p>
<p>
Only in the semi-independent district of the
Ghaïáta Berbers between Fez and Táza, which had
never been entirely subjugated, did a flame break out.
A successful writer of amulets, hitherto unknown,
one Jelálli Zarhôni, who had acquired a great local
reputation, began to denounce the Sultan's behaviour
with religious fervour. Calling on the
neighbouring tribesmen to refuse allegiance to so
unworthy a monarch, he ultimately raised the
standard of revolt in the name of the Sultan's imprisoned
elder brother, M'hammed. Finally, the
rumour ran that this prince had escaped and joined
Jelálli, who, from his habitual prophet's mount, is
better known throughout the country as Boo
Hamára&mdash;"Father of the She-ass." According to
the official statement, Jelálli Zarhôni was originally<a name="page272" id="page272"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;272]</span>
a policeman (makházni), whose bitterness and subsequent
sedition arose from ill-treatment then
received. Although exalted in newspaper reports
to the dignity of a "pretender," in Morocco he
is best known as the "Rogi" or "Common One."</p>
<p>
Fez clamoured to see M'hammed, that the story
might be disproved, and after much delay, during
which he was supposed to be conveyed from
Mequinez, a veiled and guarded rider arrived,
preceded by criers who proclaimed him to be the
Sultan's brother. But as no one could be sure if
this were the case or not, each party believed what
it wished, and Jelálli's hands were strengthened.
Boldly announcing the presence with him of Mulai
M'hammed, in his name he sought and obtained
the allegiance of tribe after tribe. Although the
Sultan effected a reconciliation with his presumed
brother&mdash;whose movements, however, still remain
restricted&mdash;serious men believe him to be in the
rebel camp, and few know the truth.</p>
<p>
At first success attended the rebellion, but it
never spread beyond the unsettled eastern provinces,
and after three years it ineffectually smoulders on,
the leader cooped up by the Sultan's forces near the
coast, though the Sultan is not strong enough to
stamp it out.</p>
<p>
By those whose knowledge of the country is
limited to newspaper news a much more serious
state of affairs is supposed to exist, a "pretender"
collecting his forces for a final coup, etc. Something
of truth there may be in this, but the situation
is grossly exaggerated. The local rising of a few
tribes in eastern Morocco never affected the rest
of the Empire, save by that feeling of unrest which,<a name="page273" id="page273"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;273]</span>
in the absence of complete information, jumps at all
tales. Even the so-called "rout" of an "imperial
army" three years ago was only a stampede without
fighting, brought about by a clever ruse, and
there has never been a serious conflict throughout
the affair, though the "Rogi" is well supplied with
arms from Algeria, and his "forces" are led by a
Frenchman, M. Delbrel. Meanwhile comparative
order reigns in the disaffected district, though in the
north, usually the most peaceful portion of the
Empire, all is disturbed.</p>
<p>
There a leader has arisen, Raïsûli by name, who
obtained redress for the wrongs of tribes south of
Tangier, and his own appointment as their kaïd, by
the astute device of carrying off as hostages an
American and an Englishman, so that the pressure
certain to be brought to bear by their Governments
would compel the Sultan to grant his demands.
All turned out as he had hoped, and the condign
punishment which he deserves is yet far off, though
a local struggle continues between him and a small
imperial force, complicated by feuds between his
sometime supporters, who, however, fight half-heartedly,
for fear of killing relatives pressed into
service on the other side. Those who once looked
to Raïsûli as a champion have found his little finger
thicker than the Sultan's loins, and the country
round Tangier is ruined by taxation, so that every
one is discontented, and the district is unsafe, a
species of civil war raging.</p>
<p>
The full name of this redoubtable leader is
Mulai Ahmad bin Mohammed bin Abd Allah er-Raïsûli,
and he is a shareef of Beni Arôs, connected
therefore with the Wazzán shareefs; but his prestige<a name="page274" id="page274"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;274]</span>
as such is low, both on account of his past career,
and because of his acceptance of a civil post. His
mother belonged to Anjera, near Tangier, where
he was born about thirty-six years ago at the village
of Zeenát, being well educated, as education goes in
Morocco, with the Beni M'sawah. But falling into
bad company, he first took to cattle-lifting, afterwards
turning highwayman, as which he was
eventually caught by the Abd es-Sadok family&mdash;various
members of which were kaïds from Ceuta
to Azîla&mdash;and consigned to prison in Mogador.
After three or four years his release was obtained
by Háj Torres, the Foreign Commissioner in Tangier,
but when he found that the Abd es-Sadoks
had sequestrated his property, he vowed not to cut
his hair till he had secured their disgrace. Hence,
with locks that many a woman might envy, he has
plotted and harassed till his present position has
been achieved. But as this is only a means to an
end, who can tell what that may be?</p>
<p>
Raïsûli is allowed on all hands to be a peculiarly
able and well-bred man, full of resource and determination.
Though his foes have succeeded in kidnapping
even his mother, it will certainly be a
miracle if he is taken alive. Should all fail him, he
is prepared to blow his brains out, or make use of a
small phial of poison always to hand. It is interesting
to remember that just such a character, Abd
Allah Ghaïlán, held a similar position in this district
when Tangier was occupied by the English, who
knew him as "Guyland," and paid him tribute.
The more recent imitation of Raïsûli's tactics by a
native free-booter of the Ceuta frontier, in arresting
two English officers as hostages wherewith to secure<a name="page275" id="page275"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;275]</span>
the release of his brother and others from prison,
has proved equally successful, but as matters stand
at present, it is more than doubtful whether the
Moorish Government is in a position to bring either
of these offenders to book, and the outlook in the
north is decidedly stormy. It is, indeed, quite in
accordance with the traditions of Moorish history,
throughout which these periods of local disorganization
have been of constant recurrence without danger
to the State.</p>

<p>
In the south things are quiet, though a spirit of
unrest pervades the people, especially since it has
been seen that the Sultan no longer either collects
the regular taxes or maintains the regular army.
There the immediate result of the failure to collect
the taxes for a year or two was that the people had
more to spend on cattle and other stock, which
rapidly rose in price, no one needing to sell unless
he wished. Within the last two years, however,
the kaïds have recommenced their oppressive treatment,
under the pretext of a levy to put down the
rising in the eastern provinces. Men and money
were several times furnished, but though now more
difficult to raise, the demands continue. The
wonder is that the people remain so quiet, but they
are of a more peaceable nature than the Berbers of
the north.</p>
<p>
Three of the Sultan's brothers have been for
some time camped in as many centres, engaged in
collecting funds, but tribe after tribe has refused to
pay, declaring that they have been exempted by
their lord, and until he returns they will submit to
no kaïd and pay no dues. It is only in certain
districts that some of the funds demanded have<a name="page276" id="page276"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;276]</span>
been forthcoming, and the kaïds have full authority,
but these are officials of long standing and great
repute, whose jurisdiction has been much extended
in consequence. Changes among the less important
kaïds have been continual of late. One man
would buy the office and struggle to establish himself,
only to find a new man installed over his head
before he was settled, which has frequently led to
local disorders, fighting and plundering. In this
way the Government has quite lost prestige, and a
strong hand is awaited.</p>
<p>
The Moors would have preferred another
Ismáïl the Bloodthirsty, who could compel his will,
and awe all other rascals in his dominions, to the
mild and well-intentioned youth now at the helm.
Some would even welcome any change that would
put an end to present insecurity, but only the
French <i>protégés</i> desire to see that change effected
by France, and only those under the German flag
already would hail that with joy. The Jews alone
would welcome any, as they have good cause to do.</p>
<p>
Such was already the condition of things when
the long-threatening clouds burst, and the Anglo-French
Agreement was published in April, 1904.
Rumours of negotiations for the sale of British
interests in Morocco to France had for some time
filled the air, but in face of official denials, and the
great esteem in which England was held by the
Moors, few gave credence to them. Mulai Abd el
Azîz had relied especially on Great Britain, and
had confidently looked to it for protection against
the French; the announcement of the bargain
between them broke him down.</p>
<p>
It may have been inevitable; and since an<a name="page277" id="page277"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;277]</span>
agreement among all the Powers concerned was so
remote a possibility, an understanding between the
three most interested may have been the wisest
course, in view of pending internal troubles which
would certainly afford excuses for interference. It
was undoubtedly good policy on their part to decide
who should inherit the vineyard, and on what terms,
that conflict between them might be avoided. But
on the unconsulted victim it came a cruel blow,
unexpected and indefensible. It is important not
to forget this.</p>
<p>
But the one absorbing thought of all for nearly
a year past has been the drought and consequent
famine. Between November, 1904, and October,
1905, there was practically no rainfall over a large
portion of the country, and agriculture being interfered
with, grain rose to five times its normal price.
Although relief has now come, it will be months
before the cattle are in proper condition again, and
not till after next year's harvest in May and June,
should it prove a good one, will contentment be
restored. Under such conditions, though more
ready than ever to grumble, the people have had
no heart to fight, which has, to some degree, assisted
in keeping them quiet. The famine has, however,
tried them sore, and only increased their exasperation.</p>
<p>
Added to this, the general feeling of dissatisfaction
regarding the Sultan's foreign predilections, and
the slumbering fanaticism of the "learned" class,
there is now a chronic lack of funds. The money
which should have been raised by taxation has been
borrowed abroad and ruthlessly scattered. Fortunes
have been made by foreigners and natives alike,
but the Sultan is all but bankrupt. Yet never was<a name="page278" id="page278"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;278]</span>
his entourage so rich, though many who to-day hold
houses and lands were a few years ago penniless.</p>
<p>
As for the future, for many years the only
answer possible to tediously frequent inquiries as
to what was going to happen in Morocco has been
that the future of the Shareefian Empire depended
entirely on what might happen in Europe, not to
any degree on its own internal condition. The
only way in which this could affect the issue was
by affording an excuse for outside interference, as
in the present case.</p>
<p>
Corrupt as the native administration may be, it
is but the expression of a corrupt population, and
no native government, even in Europe, is ever far in
advance of those over whom it rules. In spite, too,
of the pressure of injustice on the individual here
and there, the victim of to-day becomes the oppressor
of to-morrow, and such opportunities are not to be
surrendered without a protest. The vast majority
is, therefore, always in favour of present conditions,
and would rather the chances of internecine strife
than an exotic peace. No foreign ruler, however
benign, would be welcome, and no "penetration,"
however "pacific," but will be endured and resented
as a hostile wound. Even the announcement of
the Anglo-French Agreement was sufficient to
gravely accentuate the disorders of the country,
and threaten immediate complications with Europe,
by provoking attacks on Europeans who had
hitherto been safe from interference save under
exceptional circumstances. A good deal of the
present unrest is attributable to this cause alone.</p>
<p>
It is, therefore, a matter of deep regret that the
one possible remedy&mdash;joint action of the Powers in<a name="page279" id="page279"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;279]</span>
policing the Moors, as it were, by demanding essential
reforms in return for a united guarantee of
territorial integrity&mdash;was rendered impossible by
the rivalries between those Powers, especially on
the part of France. Great Britain's step aside has
made possible the only alternative, the surrender
of the coveted task to one of their number, in
return for such <i>quid pro quo</i> as each could obtain.
Had the second-class Powers been bargained with
first, not only would they have secured substantial
terms, which now it is no use their asking, but the
leading Powers could have held out for terms yet
undreamed of.</p>
<p>
France did well to begin with Great Britain,
but it was an egregious diplomatic error to overlook
Germany, which was thereby promoted to
the hitherto unhoped-for position of "next friend"
and trusted adviser of Morocco. Up to that point
Germany had played a waiting game so patiently
that France fell into the trap, and gave her all she
wanted. It is inconceivable how the astute politicians
of the Quai d'Orsay committed such a blunder, save
on the assumption that they were so carried away
by the ease with which they had settled with Great
Britain, that they forgot all other precautions&mdash;unless
it was that they feared to jeopardize the conclusion
of the main bargain by delay in discussing
any subsidiary point.</p>
<p>
When the Agreement was made known, the
writer pointed out in the <i>Westminster Review</i>,
that, "Portugal, Italy and Austria have but to
acquiesce and rest assured of the 'most favoured
nation' treatment, as will all the other Powers save
one. That one, of course, is Germany, <i>whose sole</i><a name="page280" id="page280"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;280]</span>
<i>interest in Morocco is the possibility of placing a drag
on France</i>. She will have to be dealt with. Having
disposed of England, which had real interests at
stake, in the command of the straits and the maintenance
of Gibraltar, France should be able to
accomplish this as well. Five and twenty years
ago Germany had not even a commercial interest
in Morocco. Great Britain did three-fourths of the
trade, or more, France about a tenth, Spain and
others dividing the crumbs between them. But an
active commercial policy&mdash;by the encouragement
and support of young firms in a way that made
Britishers envious, and abusive of their own Foreign
Office&mdash;has secured for Germany a growing share
of the trade, till now she stands next to Great
Britain, whose share is reduced to one-half."<a name="XXX1r" id="XXX1r"></a><a href="#XXX1"><sup>*</sup></a></p>
<p>
After all, the interests of Germany in Morocco<a name="page281" id="page281"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;281]</span>
were but a trifling consideration, meaning much less
to her than ours do to us, and it was evident that
whatever position she might assume, however she
might bluster, she, too, had her price. This not
being perceived by the ill-informed Press of this
country, the prey of political journalists in Paris,
Cologne and Madrid&mdash;more recently even of Washington,
whence the delusive reports are now re-echoed
with alarming reverberations&mdash;there was
heated talk of war, and everything that newspapers
could do to bring it about was done. Even a
private visit of the Kaiser to Tangier, the only important
feature of which was the stir made about it,
was utilized to fan the flame. However theatrical
some of the political actions of Wilhelm II. may
have been, here was a case in which, directly he
perceived the capital being made of his visit, he
curtailed it to express his disapprobation. It was
in Tangier Bay that he received the newspaper
cuttings on the subject, and although the visit was
to have extended in any case but to a few hours, he
at once decided not to land. It was only when it
was urged upon him what disappointment this
would cause to its thirty thousand inhabitants and
visitors for the occasion, that he consented to pay
one short visit to his Legation, abandoning the
more important part of the programme, which included
a climb to the citadel and an interchange of
visits with a kinsman of the Sultan. Nothing more
could have been done to emphasize the private
nature of the visit, in reality of no greater moment
than that of King Edward to Algeria almost at the
same time.</p>
<p>
Neither such a personal visit, nor any other<a name="page282" id="page282"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;282]</span>
action should have been required to remind Great
Britain and France that they and Spain alone were
affected by their agreements, and that not even
official notification to Morocco or the other Powers
could restrict their perfect liberty of action. When,
therefore, the distracted Sultan turned to Germany
as the most influential Power still faithful to its
undertakings, the response of Germany was perfectly
correct, as was his own action. But Germany,
although prepared to meet him with a smile, and
not averse to receiving crumbs in the form of
concessions, had no more intention of embroiling
herself on his behalf than Great Britain. Extraordinary
rumours, however, pervaded the country,
and the idea of German intervention was hailed with
delight; now general disappointment is felt, and
Germany is classed with England among the traitors.</p>
<p>
Mulai Abd el Azîz had but one resource, to
propose another conference of the Powers, assured
that France and Germany would never come to an
understanding, and that this would at least ward off
the fatal day indefinitely. Yet now that France
and Germany have agreed, it is probable that this
step is regretted, and that, since the two have acted
in concert, the Moorish Court has been at its wits'
ends; it would now regard as a God-send anything
which might prevent the conference from being
held, lest it should strengthen the accord among
its enemies, and weaken its own position.</p>
<p>
The diplomatic negotiations between Fez, Berlin,
and Paris have been of a character normal under the
circumstances; and as the bickerings and insinuations
which accompanied them were foreign to Morocco,
the Sultan's invitation only serving as an opportunity<a name="page283" id="page283"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;283]</span>
for arriving at an understanding, they need not be
dwelt on here. It is the French Press which has
stirred up the commotion, and has misled the British
Public into the belief that there has been some
"Morocco Tangle." The facts are simply these:
since 1880, the date of the Madrid Convention
regarding the vexed question of foreign rights of
protecting natives and holding property in Morocco,
all nations concerned have been placed on an equal
footing in their dealings with that country. The
"most favoured nation" clause has secured for all
the advantages gained by any in its special treaties.
Nothing has since occurred to destroy this situation.
In asking his "friends" to meet again in conference
now, the Sultan acted wisely and within his
rights. The fact that any two or three of them
may have agreed to give one of their number a
"free hand," should it suit her purposes to upset
the <i>status quo</i>, does not theoretically affect the
position, though it has suggested the advisability
of further discussion. It is only in virtue of their
combined might that the Powers in question are
enabled to assume the position they do.</p>
<p>
Spain, the only power with interests in Morocco
other than commercial, had been settled with by a
subsequent agreement in October, 1904, for she had
been consulted in time. Special clauses dealing
with her claims to consideration had even been
inserted in the Anglo-French Agreement&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
Art. VII. "This arrangement does not apply to the
points now occupied by Spain on the Moorish shore of the
Mediterranean.</p>
<p>
Art. VIII. "The two Governments, animated by their
sincerely friendly sentiments for Spain, take into particular<a name="page284" id="page284"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;284]</span>
consideration the interests she possesses, owing to her
geographical position and to her territorial possessions on the
Moorish shore of the Mediterranean, in regard to which
the French Government will make some arrangement with
the Spanish Government ... (which) will be communicated
to the Government of His Britannic Majesty."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
These Articles apply to Ceuta, which Spain
withheld from the Portuguese after the brief union
of the crowns in the sixteenth century; to Veléz, an
absolutely worthless rock, captured in 1564 by
Garcia de Toledo with fifteen thousand men, the
abandonment of which has more than once been
seriously urged in Spain; to Alhucemas, a small
island occupied in 1673; to Melilla, a huge rock
peninsula captured, on his own account, by Medina
Sidonia in 1497; and to the Zaffarine (or Saffron)
Islands, only one of which is used, in the seizure of
which the French were cleverly forestalled in 1848.
All are convict stations; unless heavily fortified in
a manner that at present they are not, they would
not be of sufficient value to tempt even a foe of
Spain. Ceuta and Melilla alone are worthy of
consideration, and the former is the only one it
might ever pay to fortify.</p>
<p>
So far have matters gone. The conference
asked for by Morocco&mdash;the flesh thrown to the
wolves&mdash;is to form the next Act. To this conference
the unfortunate Sultan would like to appeal
for protection against the now "free hand" of
France, but in consenting to discuss matters at all,
she and her ally have, of course, stipulated that
what has been done without reference to treaty
shall not be treated of, if they are to take part, and
as an act of courtesy to us, the United States has<a name="page285" id="page285"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;285]</span>
followed suit. Other matters of importance which
Mulai Abd el Azîz desired to discuss have also
been ruled out beforehand, so that only minor
questions are to be dealt with, hardly worth the
trouble of meeting.</p>
<p>
Foremost among these is the replenishing of the
Moorish exchequer by further loans, which might
more easily have been arranged without a conference.
Indeed, there are so many money-lenders
anxious to finance Morocco on satisfactory terms, that
the competition among them has almost degenerated
into a scramble. But all want some direct guarantee
through their Governments, which introduces the
political element, as in return for such guarantee
each Power desires to increase its interests or privileges.
Thus, while each financier holds out his gold-bags
temptingly before the Sultan, elbowing aside
his rival, each demands as surety the endorsement
of his Government, the price of which the Sultan is
hardly prepared to pay. He probably hopes that
by appealing to them all in conference, he will
obtain a joint guarantee on less onerous terms,
without affording any one of them a foothold in
his country, should he be unable to discharge his
obligations. He is wise, and but for the difficulties
caused by the defection of England and France from
the political circle, this request for money might alone
have sufficed to introduce a reformed <i>régime</i> under the
joint auspices of all. As it is, attempts to raise funds
elsewhere, even to discharge the current interest,
having failed, his French creditors, who do possess
the support of their Government, have obligingly
added interest to capital, and with official sanction
continue to roll the snowball destined one day to<a name="page286" id="page286"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;286]</span>
overwhelm the State. In the eyes of the Moors
this is nothing less than a bill-of-sale on the Empire.</p>
<p>
A second point named by the Sultan for
submission to the conference is the urgency of
submitting all inhabitants of the country without
distinction to the reformed taxation; a reasonable
demand if the taxes were reasonable and justly
assessed, but who can say at present that they
are either? The exchequer is undoubtedly defrauded
of large sums by the exemptions enjoyed
by foreigners and their <i>protégés</i>, on account of the
way in which these privileges are abused, while,
to begin with, the system itself is unfair to the
native. Here again is an excellent lever for securing
reforms by co-operation. Let the Sultan understand
that the sole condition on which such a privilege
can be abandoned is the reform of his whole fiscal
and judicial systems, and that this effected to the
satisfaction of the Powers, these privileges will be
abandoned. Nothing could do more to promote
the internal peace and welfare of Morocco than this
point rightly handled.</p>
<p>
A third demand, the abolition of foreign postal
services in his country, may appear to many curious
and insignificant, but the circumstances are peculiar.
Twenty years ago, when I first knew Morocco, there
were no means of transmitting correspondence up
country save by intermittent couriers despatched by
merchants, whom one had to hunt up at the <i>cafés</i> in
which they reposed. On arrival the bundle of letters
was carried round to likely recipients for them to
select their own in the most hap-hazard way. Things
were hardly more formal at the ports at which eagerly
awaited letters and papers arrived by sea. These<a name="page287" id="page287"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;287]</span>
were carried free from Gibraltar, and delivered on
application at the various consular offices.</p>
<p>
At one time the Moorish Government maintained
unsatisfactory courier services between two or three
of the towns, but issued no stamps, the receipt for
the courier's payment being of the nature of a postmark,
stamped at the office, which, though little
known to collectors, is the only genuine and really
valuable Moorish postage stamp obtainable. All
other so-called Morocco stamps were issued by
private individuals, who later on ran couriers
between some two Moorish towns, their income
being chiefly derived from the sale of stamps to
collectors. Some were either entirely bogus services,
or only a few couriers were run to save appearances.
Stamps of all kinds were sold at face value, postmarked
or not to order, and as the issues were from
time to time changed, the profits were steady and
good. The case was in some ways analogous to
that of the Yangtse and other treaty ports of China,
where I found every consul's wife engaged in designing
local issues, sometimes of not inconsiderable
merit. In Morocco quite a circle of stamp-dealers
sprang up, mostly sharp Jewish lads&mdash;though not
a few foreign officials contracted the fever, and some
time ago a stamp journal began to be issued in
Tangier to promote the sale of issues which otherwise
would not have been heard of.</p>
<p>
Now all is changed; Great Britain, France,
Spain and Germany maintain head postal offices
in Tangier, the British being subject to that of
Gibraltar, whose stamps are used. All have courier
services down the coast, as well as despatching by
steamer, and some maintain inland mails conveyed<a name="page288" id="page288"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;288]</span>
by runners. The distance from Tangier to Fez,
some hundred and fifty miles, is covered by one
man on foot in about three days and a half, and
the forty miles' run from Tangier to Tetuan is done
in a night for a dollar, now less than three shillings.</p>
<p>
But a more enlightened Sultan sees the advantage
it would be to him, if not to all parties, to
control the distribution of the growing correspondence
of both Europeans and natives, the
latter of whom prefer to register their letters, having
very little faith in their despatch without a receipt.
And as Mulai Abd el Azîz is willing to join the
Postal Union, provided that the service is placed
in efficient European hands there is no reason why
it should not be united in one office, and facilities
thereby increased.</p>
<p>
France, however, in joining the conference, has
quite another end in view than helping others to
bolster up the present administration, and that is to
obtain a formal recognition by all concerned, including
Morocco, of the new position created by her agreement
with Great Britain. That is to say, without
permitting her action to be questioned in any way,
she hopes to secure some show of right to what at
present she possesses only by the might of herself
and her friends. She has already agreed with
Germany to recognize her special claim for permission
to "police" the Morocco-Algerian frontier,
and those who recall the appropriation of Tunisia
will remember that it originated in "policing" the
Khomaïr&mdash;known to the French as "Kroumirs"&mdash;on
the Tunisian frontier of Algeria.</p>
<p>
It is, indeed, a curious spectacle, a group of
butchers around the unfortunate victim, talking<a name="page289" id="page289"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;289]</span>
philanthropy, practising guile: two of the strongest
have at last agreed between themselves which is to
have the carcase, but preparations for the "pacific"
death-thrust are delayed by frantic appeals for
further consultation, and by the refusal of one of
their number who had been ignored to recognize
the bargain. Consultation is only agreed to on
conditions which must defeat its object, and terms
are arranged with the intervener. Everything,
therefore, is clear for the operation; the tender-hearted
are soothed by promises that though the
"penetration" cannot but be painful, it shall at least
not be hostile; while in order that the contumacious
may hereafter hold their peace, the consultation is
to result in a formal but carefully worded death-warrant.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile it is worth while recalling the essential
features of the Madrid Convention of 1880, mainly
due to French claims for special privileges in protecting
natives, or in giving them the rights of
French citizens. This was summoned by Spain at
the suggestion of Great Britain, with the concurrence
of Morocco. Holland, Sweden and Norway,
Denmark, Belgium, Portugal, France, Germany, the
United States, Italy, Brazil, and Austria-Hungary
accepted the invitation in the order named, but
Brazil was ultimately unrepresented. Russia was
also invited as an after-thought, but did not consider
it worth while accepting. The scope of the conference
was limited to the subject of foreign protection,
though the question of property was by
mutual consent included.</p>
<p>
The representatives of the conferring Powers
accredited to the Spanish Court were nominated as<a name="page290" id="page290"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;290]</span>
members&mdash;the English Plenipotentiary acting for
Denmark&mdash;as it was felt that those accredited to
Morocco already held too decided views of the
matter. The Moorish Foreign Minister attended
on behalf of Morocco, and Señor Canovas, President
of the Council, represented Spain. Seventeen
meetings were held, under the presidency of Señor
Canovas, between May 19 and July 3, the last
being purely formal. The Convention then signed
contained little that was new, but it re-stated clearly
and harmonized with satisfactory results rights previously
granted to one and another. In several
particulars, however, its provisions are faulty, and
experience of their working has long led to demands
for revision, but conflicting interests, and fears of
opening up larger issues, have caused this to be
postponed.</p>
<p>
Now that the time has arrived for a re-definition
of the whole position and rights of foreigners and
their Governments in Morocco, it is earnestly to
be hoped that the opportunity may not be lost.
The great fault of the Madrid Convention is that
while it recognizes the right of foreigners to acquire
land in Morocco, it stipulates for the previous consent
of the native authorities, which is only to be
obtained, if at all, by liberal "presents." But the
most pressing need is the establishment of an international
tribunal for the trial of cases involving
more than one nationality, to replace the present
anarchy, resulting from the conflict in one case of
any of the thirteen independent jurisdictions at
present in force in Morocco. Such a measure
would be an outcome of more value than all possible
agreements to respect the independence and integrity<a name="page291" id="page291"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;291]</span>
of Morocco till it suited the purpose of one party
or another to encroach thereon.</p>
<p>
In lands knowing but one jurisdiction it is hard
to conceive the abuses and defeats of justice which
result from the confusion reigning in Morocco, or
those which existed in Egypt previous to the
establishment of international tribunals there. For
instance, plaintiff, of nationality A., sues defendants,
of nationalities B., C., and D., for the return of goods
which they have forcibly carried off, on the ground
that they were pledged to them by a party of
nationality E., who disputes their claim, and declares
the goods sold to original plaintiff. Here are five
jurisdictions involved, each with a different set of
laws, so that during the three separate actions
necessitated, although the three defendants have all
acted alike and together, the judgment in the case
of each may be different, <i>e.g.</i> case under law B. dismissed,
that under law C. won by plaintiff, while
law D. might recognize the defendants' claim, but
condemn his action. Needless to follow such intricacies
further, though this is by no means an
extreme case, for disputes are constantly occurring&mdash;to
say nothing of criminal actions&mdash;involving the
several consular courts, for the most part presided
over by men unequipped by legal training, in which
it is a practical impossibility for justice to be done
to all, and time and money are needlessly wasted.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="XXX1" id="XXX1"></a>
<a href="#XXX1r">*</a> It is curious, indeed, how little the German Empire or its component
States figure in the history of diplomatic relations with
Morocco. One has to go back to the time of Rudolf II., in 1604, to
find an active policy in force with regard to Moroccan affairs, when
that remarkable adventurer or international diplomatist, Sir Anthony
Sherley, was accredited to Abd el Azîz III., the last of the Moorish
rulers to bear the same name as the present one. This intrepid
soldier, a man after the Kaiser's own heart, had been accredited to
Germany by the great Shah of Persia, Abbás, whose confidence he
had won to a marvellous degree, and he appears to have made as
great an impression on Rudolf, who sent him as his envoy to Morocco.
Arrived there, he astonished the natives by coolly riding into the court
of audience&mdash;a privilege still reserved to the Sultan alone. But the
Ameer, as he was called in those days, was too politic or too polite to
raise the question, only taking care that the next time the "dog of a
Christian" should find a chain stretched across the gateway. This
Sir Anthony could not brook, so rode back threatening to break off
negotiations, and it affords a striking lesson as to the right way of
dealing with orientals, that even in those days the Moors should
have yielded and imprisoned the porter, permitting Sir Anthony's
entrance on horseback thereafter. The treaty he came to negotiate
was concluded, and relations with the Germans were established on a
right footing, but they have been little in evidence till recent years.</p>

<h3>XXXI</h3>

<h2>FRANCE IN MOROCCO</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Who stands long enough at the door is sure to enter at last."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
In a previous work on this country, "The Land of
the Moors," published in 1901, the present writer
concluded with this passage: "France alone is to
be feared in the Land of the Moors, which, as things
trend to-day, must in time form part of her colony.
There is no use disguising the fact, and, as England
certainly would not be prepared to go to war with
her neighbour to prevent her repeating in Morocco
what she has done in Tunis, it were better not to
grumble at her action. All England cares about is
the mouth of the Mediterranean, and if this were
secured to her, or even guaranteed neutral&mdash;were
that possible&mdash;she could have no cause to object to
the French extension. Our Moorish friends will
not listen to our advice; they keep their country
closed, as far as they can, refusing administrative
reforms which would prevent excuses for annexation.
Why should we trouble them? It were
better far to come to an agreement with France,
and acknowledge what will prove itself one day&mdash;that
France is the normal heir to Morocco whenever
the present Empire breaks up."</p>

<a name="page293" id="page293"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;293]</span>
<p>
Unpopular as this opinion was among the British
and other foreign subjects in the country, and
especially among the Moors, so that it had at first
no other advocate, it has since been adopted in
Downing Street, and what is of more moment, acted
upon. Nay more, Great Britain has, in return for
the mere recognition of a <i>fait accompli</i> in Egypt,
agreed to stand aside in Morocco, and to grant
France a free hand in any attempt to create there
a similar state of things. Though the principle
was good, the bargain was bad, for the positions
of the two contracting Powers, in Egypt and
Morocco respectively, were by no means analogous.
France could never have driven us out of Egypt
save with her sword at our throat; England had
but to unite with other Powers in blocking the way
of France in Morocco to stultify all her plans. Had
England stood out for terms, whether as regarding
her commercial interests in Morocco, which have
been disgracefully sacrificed, or in the form of concessions
elsewhere, a very much more equal-handed
bargain might have been secured.</p>
<p>
The main provisions of the agreement between
the two countries, concluded April 8, 1904, are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
Art. II. "The British Government recognizes that it
appertains to France, more especially as being the Power
in contiguity with Morocco, to control the peace of the
country, and to lend its assistance in all administrative,
economical, financial, and military reforms. The British
Government declares that it will not interfere with the
action of France in this regard, provided that this action
will leave intact the rights which, in virtue of treaties, conventions,
and usages, Great Britain enjoys in Morocco,
including the right of coasting between the Morocco ports,
of which English vessels have had the benefit since 1901."</p>

<a name="page294" id="page294"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;294]</span>
<p>
Art. VII. "In order to secure the free passage of the
Straits of Gibraltar, both Governments agree not to allow
fortifications or any strategic works to be erected on that
part of the Moorish coast between Melilla and the heights
which dominate the right bank of the Sebu exclusively."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
France has secured all that she wanted, or rather
that her aggressive colonial party wanted, for
opinions on that point are by no means identical,
even in France, and the Agreement at once called
forth the condemnation of the more moderate party.
What appears to be permissive means much more.
Now that Great Britain has drawn back&mdash;the
Power to which the late Sir John Drummond Hay
taught the Moors to look with an implicit confidence
to champion them against all foes, as it did
in the case of the wars with France and Spain,
vetoing the retention of a foot of Moorish soil&mdash;Morocco
lies at the feet of France. France, indeed,
has become responsible for carrying out a task its
eager spirits have been boiling over for a chance of
undertaking. Morocco has been made the ward of
the hand that gripped it, which but recently filched
two outlying provinces, Figig and Tûát.</p>
<p>
Englishmen who know and care little about
Morocco are quite incapable of understanding the
hold that France already had upon this land.
Separated from it only by an unprotected boundary,
much better defined on paper than in fact, over
which there is always a "rectification" dispute in
pickle, her province of Algeria affords a prospective
base already furnished with lines of rail from her
ports of Oran and Algiers. From Oojda, an
insignificant town across the border from Lalla
Maghnîa (Marnia), there runs a valley route which<a name="page295" id="page295"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;295]</span>
lays Fez in her power, with Táza by the way to
fortify and keep the mountaineers in check. At
any time the frontier forays in which the tribes on
both sides indulge may be fomented or exaggerated,
as in the case of Tunis, to afford a like excuse for a
similar occupation, which beyond a doubt would be
a good thing for Morocco. Fez captured, and the
seaports kept in awe or bombarded by the navy,
Mequinez would fall, and an army landed in
Mazagan would seize Marrákesh.</p>
<p>
All this could be accomplished with a minimum
of loss, for only the lowlands would have to be
crossed, and the mountaineers have no army. But
their "pacification" would be the lingering task in
which lives, time, and money would be lost beyond
all recompense. Against a European army that of
the Sultan need not be feared; only a few battalions
drilled by European officers might give trouble,
but they would see former instructors among the
foe, and without them they would soon become demoralized.
It would be the tribal skirmishers, of
whom half would fall before the others yielded to
the Nazarenes, who would give the trouble.</p>
<p>
The military mission which France has for many
years imposed on the Sultan at his expense, though
under her control, which follows him in his expeditions
and spies out the land, has afforded a training-ground
for a series of future invading leaders. Her
Algerian Mohammedan agents are able to pass and
repass where foreigners never go, and besides
collecting topographical and other information, they
have lost no opportunity of making known the
privileges and advantages of French rule. In case
it may be found advisable to set up a dummy<a name="page296" id="page296"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;296]</span>
sultan under a protectorate, the French have an able
and powerful man to hand in the young Idreesi
Shareef of Wazzán, whom the English refused to
protect, and who, with his brother, received a French
education.</p>
<p>
But while we, as a nation, have been unable to
comprehend the French determination to possess
Morocco, they have been unable to comprehend
our calm indifference, and by the way in which
they betray their suspicions of us, they betray their
own methods. Protestant missionaries in Algeria
and Tunisia, of whatever nationality, are supposed
to be the emissaries of the British Government, and
in consequence are harassed and maligned, while
tourists outside the regular beat are watched. When
visiting Oojda some years ago, I myself was twice
arrested in Algeria, at Tlemçen and Lalla Maghnîa,
because mingling with natives, and it was with
difficulty that I could persuade the <i>juges d'instruction</i>
of my peaceful motives.</p>
<p>
Determined and successful efforts to become
acquainted with the remotest provinces of Morocco,
the distribution of its population, and whatever could
be of use to an invading or "pacifying" force have
long been made by France, but the most valuable
portion of this knowledge remains pigeon-holed, or
circulates only in strictly official <i>mémoires</i>. Many
of the officials engaged here, however, have amused
themselves and the public by publishing pretty
books of the average class, telling little new, while
one even took the trouble to write his in English,
in order to put us off the scent!</p>
<p>
If ever means could justify an end, France
deserves to enjoy the fruit of her labours. No<a name="page297" id="page297"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;297]</span>
longer need she foment strife on the Algerian
frontier, or wink at arms being smuggled across
it; no longer need the mis-named "pretender" be
supplied with French gold, or intrigues be carried
on at Court. Abd el Azîz must take the advice
and "assistance" of France, whether he will or
no, and curse the British to whom he formerly
looked. This need not necessarily involve such
drastic changes as would rouse the people to rebellion,
and precipitate a costly conquest. There
are many reforms urgently required in the interests
of the people themselves, and these can now be
gradually enforced. Such reforms had been set on
foot already by the young Sultan, mainly under
British advice; but to his chagrin, his advisers did
not render the financial and moral support he needed
to carry them out. France is now free to do this,
and to strengthen his position, so that all wise reforms
may be possible. These will naturally commence
with civil and judicial functions, but must
soon embrace the more pressing public works, such
as roads, bridges, and port improvements. Railways
are likely to be the first roads in most parts, and
Mulai Abd el Azîz will welcome their introduction.
The western ideas which he has imbibed during the
last few years are scoffed at only by those who know
little of him. What France will have to be prepared
for is Court intrigue, and she will have to
give the Moors plainly to understand that "Whatsoever
king shall reign, she'll still be 'boss of the
show,' sir."</p>
<p>
As one of the first steps needed, but one requiring
the co-operation of all other Powers on treaty
terms with the Moors, the establishment of tribunals<a name="page298" id="page298"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;298]</span>
to which all should be amenable, has already been
touched upon. These must necessarily be presided
over by specially qualified Europeans in
receipt of sufficient salary to remove them from
temptation. A clear distinction should then be
made between a civil code administered by such
tribunals and the jurisdiction of the Muslim law in
matters of religion and all dependent upon it. But
of even more pressing importance is the reform of
the currency, and the admission of Morocco to the
Latin Union. This could well be insisted on when
the financial question is discussed at the Algeciras
Conference, as well as the equally important establishment
in competent hands of a State Bank.
This and the reform of the whole fiscal system
must precede every other measure, as they form
the ground-work of the whole.</p>
<p>
Whatever public works may be eventually undertaken,
the first should be, as far as possible, such as
the Moors themselves can execute under European
direction, and as they can appreciate. Irrigation
would command enthusiasm where railways would
only provoke opposition, and the French could find
no surer way of winning the hearts of the people
than by coping at once with the agricultural water
supply, in order to provide against such years of
famine as the present, and worse that are well
remembered. That would be a form of "pacific
penetration," to which none could object.</p>
<p>
Education, too, when attempted, should be
gradually introduced as a means of personal advancement,
the requirements of the public service being
raised year by year, as the younger generation has
had opportunities of better qualifying themselves.<a name="page299" id="page299"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;299]</span>
Above all, every post should be in theory at least
thrown open to the native, and in practice as soon
as the right man turned up. Better retain or
instal more of the able Moors of to-day as figureheads
with European advisers, than attempt a new
set to start with. But a clean sweep should be
made of the foreigners at present in the Moorish
service, all of whom should be adequately pensioned
off, that with the new order might come new men,
adequately paid and independent of "commissions."
It is essential that the people learn to feel that they
are not being exploited, but that their true welfare
is sought. Every reform should be carried out
along native lines, and in conformity with native
thought.</p>

<b>TUNISIA UNDER THE FRENCH&mdash;AN EXECUTION.</b>
</p><br /><br />

<p>
The costly lesson of Algeria, where native rights
and interests were overthrown, and a complete detested
foreign rule set up, has taught the French
the folly of such a system, however glorious it may
appear on paper. They have been wiser in Tunisia,
where a nominally native government is directed
by Frenchmen, whom it pays, and sooner or later
Morocco is almost certain to become a second
Tunisia. This will not only prove the best working
system, but it will enable opposition to be dealt
with by Moorish forces, instead of by an invading
army, which would unite the Berber tribes under
the Moorish flag. This was what prolonged the
conquest of Algeria for so many years, and the
Berbers of Morocco are more independent and
better armed than were those of Algeria seventy
years ago. What France will gain by the change
beyond openings for Frenchmen and the glory of
an extended colonial empire, it is hard to imagine,
<a name="page300" id="page300"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;300]</span>
but empty glory seems to satisfy most countries
greedy of conquest. So far the only outward evidences
of the new position are the over-running of
the ports, especially of Tangier, by Frenchmen of
an undesirable class, and by an attempt to establish
a French colony at the closed port of Mehedîya
by doubtful means, to say nothing of the increased
smuggling of arms.</p>
<p>
How the welfare of the Moors will be affected
by the change is a much more important question,
though one often held quite unworthy of consideration,
the accepted axiom being that, whether they
like it or not, what is good for us is good for them.
Needless to say that most of the reforms required
will be objected to, and that serious obstacles
will be opposed to some; the mere fact that the
foreigner, contemptuously called a "Nazarene," is
their author, is sufficient to prejudice them in native
eyes, and the more prominent the part played by
him, the more difficult to follow his advice. But if
the Sultan and his new advisers will consent to a
wise course of quiet co-operation, much may be
effected without causing trouble. It is astonishing
how readily the Moors submit to the most radical
changes when unostentatiously but forcibly carried
out. Never was there a greater call for the <i>suaviter
in modo, fortiter in re</i>. Power which makes itself
felt by unwavering action has always had their
respect, and if the Sultan is prepared not to act
till with gold in his coffers, disciplined troops at his
command, and loyal officials to do his behest, he
can do so with unquestioned finality, all will go well.</p>
<p>
Then will the prosperity of the people revive&mdash;indeed,
achieve a condition hitherto unknown save
<a name="page301" id="page301"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;301]</span>
in two or three reigns of the distant past, perhaps
not then. The poor will not fear to sow their
barren fields, or the rich to display their wealth;
hidden treasure will come to light, and the groan of
the oppressed will cease.  Individual cases of gross
injustice will doubtless arise; but they will be
as nothing compared with what occurs in Morocco
to-day, even with that wrought by Europeans
who avail themselves of existing evils. So that if
France is wise, and restrains her hot-heads, she
may perform a magnificent work for the Moors, as
the British have done in Egypt; at least, it is to be
hoped she may do as well in Morocco as in Tunisia.</p>
<p>
But it would be idle to ignore the deep dissatisfaction
with which the Anglo-French Agreement
has been received by others than the Moors.<a name="XXXI1r" id="XXXI1r"></a><a href="#XXXI1"><sup>*</sup></a>
Most British residents in Morocco, probably every
tourist who has been conducted along the coast,
or sniffed at the capital cities; those firms of ours
who share the bulk of the Moorish trade, and
others who yearned to open up possible mines, and
undertake the public works so urgently needed;
ay, and the concession-prospectors and company-mongers
who see the prey eluding their grasp; even
the would-be heroes across the straits who have
dreamed in vain of great deeds to be done on those
hills before them; all unite in deploring what
appears to them a gross blunder. After all, this
is but natural. So few of us can see beyond our
own domains, so many hunger after anything&mdash;in
their particular line&mdash;that belongs to a weaker
neighbour, that it is well we have disinterested
statesmen who take a wider view.  Else had we<a name="page302" id="page302"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;302]</span>
long since attempted to possess ourselves of the
whole earth, like the conquering hordes of Asia,
and in consequence we should have been dispossessed
ourselves.</p>
<p>
Even to have been driven to undertake in
Morocco a task such as we were in Egypt, would
have been a calamity, for our hands are too full
already of similar tasks. It is all very well in these
times of peace, but in the case of war, when we
might be attacked by more than one antagonist, we
should have all our work cut out to hold what
we have. The policy of "grab," and dabbing
the world with red, may be satisfactory up to a
certain point, but it will be well for us as a nation
when we realize that we have had enough. In
Morocco, what is easy for France with her contiguous
province, with her plans for trans-Sáharan
traffic, and her thirst to copy our colonial expansion&mdash;though
without men to spare&mdash;would have been
for us costly and unremunerative. We are well quit
of the temptation.</p>
<p>
Moreover, we have freed ourselves of a possible,
almost certain, cause of friction with France, of
itself a most important gain. Just as France would
never have acquiesced in our establishing a protectorate
in Morocco without something more
than words, so the rag-fed British public, always
capable of being goaded to madness by the newspapers,
would have bitterly objected to French
action, if overt, while powerless to prevent the
insidious grasp from closing on Morocco by degrees.
The first war engaging at once British attention
and forces was like to see France installed in
Morocco without our leave. The early reverses of<a name="page303" id="page303"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;303]</span>
the Transvaal War induced her to appropriate Tûát
and Figig, and had the fortune of war been against
us, Morocco would have been French already.
These facts must not be overlooked in discussing
what was our wisest course. We were unprepared
to do what France was straining to do: we
occupied the manger to no one's good&mdash;practically
the position later assumed by Germany. Surely we
were wiser to come to terms while we could, not as
in the case of Tunisia, when too late.</p>
<p>
But among the objecting critics one class has
a right to be heard, those who have invested life
and fortune in the Morocco trade; the men who
have toiled for years against the discouraging odds
involved, who have wondered whether Moorish
corruption or British apathy were their worst foe, in
whom such feeling is not only natural but excusable.
Only those who have experienced it know what it
means to be defrauded by complacent Orientals, and
to be refused the redress they see officials of other
nations obtaining for rivals. Yet now they find all
capped by the instructions given to our consuls not
to act without conferring with the local representatives
of France, which leads to the taunt that Great
Britain has not only sold her interests in Morocco
to the French, but also her subjects!</p>
<p>
The British policy has all along been to maintain
the <i>status quo</i> in spite of individual interests,
deprecating interference which might seem high-handed,
or create a precedent from which retraction
would be difficult. In the collection of debts, in
enforcing the performance of contracts, or in securing
justice of any kind where the policy is to promise
all and evade all till pressure is brought to bear,<a name="page304" id="page304"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;304]</span>
British subjects in Morocco have therefore always
found themselves at a disadvantage in competition
with others whose Governments openly supported
them. The hope that buoyed them up was that
one day the tide might turn, and that Great Britain
might feel it incumbent on her to "protect"
Morocco against all comers. Now hope has fled.
What avails it that grace of a generation's span
is allowed them, that they may not individually
suffer from the change? It is the dream of years
that lies shattered.</p>
<p>
Here are the provisions for their protection:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Art. IV. "The two Governments, equally attached to
the principle of commercial liberty, both in Egypt and
Morocco, declare that they will not lend themselves to
any inequality either in the establishment of customs
rights or other taxes, or in the establishment of tariffs
for transport on the railways.... This mutual agreement
is valid for a period of thirty years" (subject to extensions
of five years).</p>
<p>
Art. V. secures the maintenance in their posts of British
officials in the Moorish service, but while it is specially
stipulated that French missionaries and schools in Egypt
shall not be molested, British missionaries in Morocco are
committed to the tender mercies of the French.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Thus there can be no immediate exhibition of
favouritism beyond the inevitable placing of all concessions
in French hands, and there is really not
much ground of complaint, while there is a hope of
cause for thankfulness. Released from its former
bugbears, no longer open to suspicion of secret
designs, our Foreign Office can afford to impart a
little more backbone into its dealings with Moorish
officials; a much more acceptable policy should,<a name="page305" id="page305"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;305]</span>
therefore, be forthwith inaugurated, that the Morocco
traders may see that what they have lost in possibilities
they have gained in actualities. Still more!
the French, now that their hands are free, are in a
position to "advise" reforms which will benefit all.
Thus out of the ashes of one hope another rises.</p>

<h2>PART III</h2>

<h3>XXXII</h3>

<h2>ALGERIA VIEWED FROM MOROCCO</h2>

<p class="center1">
"One does not become a horseman till one has fallen."</p>

<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
A journey through Algeria shows what a stable
and enlightened Government has been able to do
in a land by no means so highly favoured by Nature
as Morocco, and peopled by races on the whole
inferior. The far greater proportion of land there
under cultivation emphasizes the backward state
of Morocco, although much of it still remains untouched;
while the superior quality of the produce,
especially of the fruits, shows what might
be accomplished in the adjoining country were its
condition improved. The hillsides of Algeria are
in many districts clothed with vines which prosper
exceedingly, often almost superseding cereals as
objects of cultivation by Europeans.</p>
<p>
The European colonists are of all nationalities,
and the proportion which is not French is astonishingly
large, but every inducement is held out for
naturalization as Algerians, and all legitimate
obstacles are thrown in the way of those who
maintain fidelity to their fatherlands. Every effort<a name="page308" id="page308"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;308]</span>
is made to render Algeria virtually part of France,
as politically it is already considered to be. It is
the case of the old days of slavery revived under a
new form, when the renegade was received with
open arms, and the man who remained steadfast
was seldom released from slavery. Of course, in
these days there is nothing approaching such treatment,
and it is only the natives who suffer to any
extent.</p>
<p>
These are despised, if not hated, and despise
and hate in return. The conquerors have repeated
in Algeria the old mistake which has brought about
such dire results in other lands, of always retaining
the position of conquerors, and never unbending to
the conquered, or encouraging friendship with them.
This attitude nullifies whatever good may result
from the mixed schools in which Muslim, Jew, and
European are brought in contact, in the hope of
turning out a sort of social amalgam. Most of the
French settlers are too conceited and too ignorant
to learn Arabic, though this is by no means the
fault of the Government, which provides free public
classes for instruction in that language in the chief
towns of Algeria and Tunisia. The result is that
the natives who meet most with foreigners have,
without the most ordinary facilities enjoyed by
the Europeans, to pick up a jargon which often
does much more credit to them than the usual
light acquaintance of the foreigner with Arabic
does to him. Those who make any pretence at
it, usually speak it with an accent, a pronunciation
and a nonchalance which show that they have
taken no pains whatever to acquire it. Evidently
it pays better to spend money educating natives<a name="page309" id="page309"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;309]</span>
in French than Frenchmen in Arabic. It is an
amusing fact that most of the teachers have produced
their own text-books, few of which possess
special merit.</p>
<p>
As a colony Algeria has proved a failure.
Foreign settlers hold most of the desirable land,
and till it with native labour. The native may
have safety and justice now, but he has suffered
terribly in the past, as the reports of the Bureau
Arabe, established for his protection, abundantly
prove, and bitterly he resents his fate. No love is
lost between French and natives in Tunisia, but
there is actual hatred in Algeria, fostered by the
foreigner far more than by the smouldering bigotry
of Islám. They do not seem to intermingle even
as oil and water, but to follow each a separate,
independent course.</p>
<p>
Among the foreign colonists it is a noteworthy
fact that the most successful are not the French,
who want too much comfort, but almost any of the
nationalities settled there, chiefly Spaniards and
Italians. The former are to be found principally
in the neighbourhood of Óran, and the latter further
east; they abound in Tunisia. Englishmen and
others of more independent nature have not been
made welcome in either country, and year by year
their interests have dwindled. Even in Tunisia,
under a different system, the same result has been
achieved, and every restriction reconcilable with
paper rights has been placed on other than French
imports. There may be an "open door," but
it is too closely guarded for us. The English
houses that once existed have disappeared, and
what business is done with this country has<a name="page310" id="page310"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;310]</span>
had to take refuge with agents, for the most part
Jews.</p>
<p>
In studying the life of Algerian towns, the almost
entire absence of well-to-do Arabs or Berbers is
striking. I never came across one who might be
judged from his appearance to be a man of means
or position, unless in military or official garb, though
there are doubtless many independent natives
among the Berber and Arab tribes. The few
whom I encountered making any pretence of dressing
well were evidently of no social rank, and the
complaint on every hand is that the natives are
being gradually ousted from what little is left to
them.</p>
<p>
As for European law, they consider this to have
no connection with justice, and think themselves
very heavily taxed to support innovations with
which they have no concern, and which they would
rather dispense with. One can, indeed, feel for
them, though there is no doubt much to be said
on both sides, especially when it is the other side
which boasts the power, if not the superior intelligence.
The Jews, however, thrive, and in many
ways have the upper hand, especially so since the
wise move which accorded them the rights of
French citizenship. It is remarkable, however,
how much less conspicuous they are in the groups
about the streets than in Morocco, notwithstanding
that their dress is quite as distinctive as there,
though different.</p>
<p>
The new-comer who arrives at the fine port of
Algiers finds it as greatly transformed as its name
has been from the town which originally bore it,
El Jazîrah.  The fine appearance of the rising<a name="page311" id="page311"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;311]</span>
tiers of houses gives an impression of a still larger
city than it really is, for very little is hidden from
view except the suburbs. From a short way out
to sea the panorama is grand, but it cannot be as
chaste as when the native city clustered in the
hollow with its whitewashed houses and its many
minarets, completely surrounded by green which
has long since disappeared under the advancing tide
of bricks and mortar. One can hardly realize that
this fine French city has replaced the den of pirates
of such fearful histories. Yet there is the original
light-house, the depôt for European slaves, and away
on the top of yonder hill are remains of the ancient
citadel. It was there, indeed, that those dreadful
cruelties were perpetrated, where so many Christians
suffered martyrdom. Yes, this is where once stood
the "famous and war-like city, El Jazîrah," which
was in its time "the scourge of Christendom."</p>
<p>
Whether the visitor be pleased or disappointed
with the modern city depends entirely on what he
seeks. If he seeks Europe in Africa, with perhaps
just a dash of something oriental, he will be amply
satisfied with Algiers, which is no longer a native
city at all. It is as French as if it had risen from
the soil entirely under French hands, and only the
slums of the Arab town remain. The seeker after
native life will therefore meet with complete disappointment,
unless he comes straight from Europe,
with no idea what he ought to expect. All the
best parts of the town, the commercial and the
residential quarters, have long since been replaced
by European substitutes, leaving hardly a trace of
the picturesque originals, while every day sees a
further encroachment on the erstwhile African<a name="page312" id="page312"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;312]</span>
portion, the interest of which is almost entirely removed
by the presence of crowds of poor Europeans
and European-dressed Jews. The visitor to Algiers
would therefore do well to avoid everything native,
unless he has some opportunity of also seeing something
genuine elsewhere. The only specimens he
meets in the towns are miserable half-caste fellows&mdash;by
habit, if not by birth,&mdash;for their dress, their
speech, their manners, their homes, their customs,
their religion&mdash;or rather their lack of religion,&mdash;have
all suffered from contact with Europeans. But even
before the Frenchmen came, it is notorious how the
Algerines had sunk under the bane of Turkish rule,
as is well illustrated by their own saying, that where
the foot of the Turk had trod, grass refused to
grow. Of all the Barbary States, perhaps none
has suffered more from successive outside influences
than the people of Algeria.</p>
<p>
The porter who seizes one's luggage does not
know when he is using French words or Arabic, or
when he introduces Italian, Turkish, or Spanish,
and cannot be induced to make an attempt at Arabic
to a European unless the latter absolutely refuses to
reply to his jargon. Then comes a hideous corruption
of his mother tongue, in which the foreign
expressions are adorned with native inflexions in
the most comical way. His dress is barbarous,
an ancient and badly fitting pair of trousers, and
stockingless feet in untidy boots, on the heels of
which he stamps along the streets with a most
unpleasant noise. The collection of garments which
complete his attire are mostly European, though
the "Fez" cap remains the distinctive feature of
the Muslim's dress, and a selhám&mdash;that cloak of<a name="page313" id="page313"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;313]</span>
cloaks, there called a "bûrnûs"&mdash;is slung across his
shoulder. Some few countrymen are to be seen
who still retain the more graceful native costume,
with the typical camel-hair or cotton cord bound
round the head-dress, but the old inhabitants are
being steadily driven out of town.</p>

<br /><a name="tent2" id="tent2"></a><br />
<p class="center">
<a href="images/313.jpg"><img src="images/313-500.jpg" width="499" height="309" alt="TENT OF AN ALGERIAN SHEÏKH." border="0" /></a><br /><br />
<br />
<b>TENT OF AN ALGERIAN SHEÏKH.</b>
</p><br /><br />

<p>
The characteristic feature of Algerian costumes
is the head-cord referred to, which pervades a great
part of Arabdom, in Syria and Arabia being composed
of two twists of black camel hair perhaps
an inch thick. In Algeria it is about an eighth of
an inch thick, and brown. The slippers are also
characteristic, but ugly, being of black leather,
excellently made, and cut very far open, till it
becomes an art to keep them on, and the heels
have to be worn up. The use of the white selhám
is almost universal, unhemmed at the edges, as in
Tunis also; and over it is loosely tied a short haïk
fastened on the head by the cord.</p>

<p>
There is, however, even in Algiers itself, one
class of men who remain unaffected by their
European surroundings, passive amid much change,
a model for their neighbours. These are the Beni
M'záb, a tribe of Mohammedan Protestants from
southern Algeria, where they settled long ago, as
the Puritans did in New England, that they might
there worship God in freedom. They were the
Abadîya, gathered from many districts, who have
taken their modern name from the tribe whose
country they now inhabit. They speak a dialect of
Berber, and dress in a manner which is as distinctive
as their short stature, small, dark, oily features, jet-black
twinkling eyes, and scanty beard. They come
to the towns to make money, and return home to<a name="page314" id="page314"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;314]</span>
spend it, after a few years of busy shop-keeping. A
butcher whom I met said that he and a friend had
the business year and year about, so as not to be
too long away from home at a time. They are
very hard-working, and have a great reputation for
honesty; they keep their shops open from about
five in the morning till nine at night. As the Beni
M'záb do not bring their wives with them, they
usually live together in a large house, and have
their own mosque, where they worship alone, resenting
the visits of all outsiders, even of other
Muslims. Admission to their mosque is therefore
practically refused to Europeans, but in Moorish
dress I was made welcome as some distinguished
visitor from saintly Fez, and found it very plain,
more like the kûbbah of a saint-house than an
ordinary mosque.</p>
<p>
There are also many Moors in Algeria, especially
towards the west. These, being better workmen than
the Algerines, find ready employment as labourers
on the railways. Great numbers also annually visit
Óran and the neighbourhood to assist at harvest
time. Those Moors who live there usually disport
themselves in trousers, strange to stay, and, when
they can afford it, carry umbrellas. They still adhere
to the turban, however, instead of adopting the
head cord. At Blidah I found that all the sellers
of sfinges&mdash;yeast fritters&mdash;were Moors, and those
whom I came across were enthusiastic to find one
who knew and liked their country. The Algerines
affect to despise them and their home, which they
declare is too poor to support them, thus accounting
for their coming over to work.</p>
<p>
The specimens of native architecture to be met<a name="page315" id="page315"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;315]</span>
with in Algeria are seldom, if ever, pure in style,
and are generally extremely corrupt. The country
never knew prosperity as an independent kingdom,
such as Morocco did, and it is only in Tlemçen, on
the borders of that Empire, that real architectural
wealth is found, but then this was once the capital
of an independent kingdom. The palace at Constantine
is not Moorish at all, except in plan, being
adorned with a hap-hazard collection of odds and
ends from all parts. It is worse than even the
Bardo at Tunis, where there is some good plaster
carving&mdash;naksh el hadeed&mdash;done by Moorish or
Andalucian workmen. In the palaces of the Governor
and the Archbishop of Algiers, which are also very
composite, though not without taste, there is more
of this work, some of it very fine, though much of it
is merely modern moulded imitation.</p>
<p>
Of more than a hundred mosques and shrines
found in Algiers when it was taken by the French,
only four of the former and a small number of the
latter remain, the rest having been ruthlessly turned
into churches. The Mosque of Hasan, built just
over a century ago, is now the cathedral, though for
this transformation it has been considerably distorted,
and a mock-Moorish façade erected in the
very worst taste. Inside things are better, having
been less interfered with, but what is now a church
was never a good specimen of a mosque, having
been originally partly European in design, the work
of renegades. The same may be said of the Mosque
of the Fisheries, a couple of centuries old, built in
the form of a Greek cross! One can well understand
how the Dey, according to the story, had the
architect put to death on discovering this anomaly.<a name="page316" id="page316"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;316]</span>
These incongruities mar all that is supposed in
Algeria to be Arabesque. The Great Mosque,
nevertheless, is more ancient and in better style,
more simple, more chaste, and more awe-inspiring.
The Zawîah of Sîdi Abd er-Rahmán, outside the
walls, is as well worth a visit as anything in Algiers,
being purely and typically native. It is for the
opportunities given for such peeps as this that one
is glad to wander in Algeria after tasting the real
thing in Morocco, where places of worship and baths
are closed to Europeans. These latter I found
all along North Africa to be much what they are
in Morocco, excepting only the presence of the
foreigners.</p>
<p>
The tile work of Algeria is ugly, but many of
the older Italian and other foreign specimens are
exceptionally good, both in design and colour.
Some of the Tunisian tiles are also noteworthy,
but it is probable that none of any real artistic value
were ever produced in what is now conveniently
called Algeria. There is nothing whatever in either
country to compare with the exquisite Fez work
found in the Alhambra, hardly to rival the inferior
productions of Tetuan. A curious custom in Algeria
is to use all descriptions of patterns together
"higgledy-piggledy," upside down or side-ways,
as though the idea were to cover so much surface
with tiling, irrespective of design. Of course this
is comparatively modern, and marks a period since
what art Algeria ever knew had died out. It is
noticeable, too, how poor the native manufacturers
are compared with those of Morocco, themselves of
small account beside those of the East. The wave
of civilization which swept over North Africa in the<a name="page317" id="page317"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;317]</span>
Middle Ages failed to produce much effect till it
recoiled upon itself in the far, far west, and then
turned northward into Spain.</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding all this, Algeria affords an
ample field for study for the scientist, especially
the mountain regions to the south, where Berber
clans and desert tribes may be reached in a manner
impossible yet in Morocco, but the student of
oriental life should not visit them till he has learnt
to distinguish true from false among the still behind-hand
Moors.</p>

<h3>XXXIII</h3>

<h2>TUNISIA VIEWED FROM MOROCCO</h2>

<p class="center1">
"The slave toils, but the Lord completes."</p>

<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
Fortunately for the French, the lesson learned in
Algeria was not neglected when the time came for
their "pacific penetration" of Tunisia. Their first
experience had been as conquerors of anything but
pacific intent, and for a generation they waged war
with the Berber tribes. Everywhere, even on the
plains, where conquest was easy, the native was
dispossessed. The land was allotted to Frenchmen
or to natives who took the oath of allegiance to
France, and became French subjects. Those who
fought for their fatherland were driven off, the
villages depopulated, and the country laid waste. In
the cities the mosques were desecrated or appropriated
to what the native considered idolatrous
worship. They have never been restored to their
owners. Those Algerines only have flourished
who entered the French army or Government
service, and affected manners which all but cut
them off from their fellow-countrymen.</p>
<p>
In Tunisia the French succeeded, under cover
of specious assurances to the contrary, in overthrowing
the Turkish beys, rehabilitating them in
name as their puppets, with hardly more opposition
<a name="page319" id="page319"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;319]</span>
than the British met with in Burma. The result
is a nominally native administration which takes
the blame for failures, and French direction which
takes the credit for successes. All that was best
in Algeria has been repeated, but native rights
have been respected, and the cities, with their
mosques and shrines, left undisturbed as far as
possible. The desecration of the sacred mosque
of Kaïrwán as a stable was a notable exception.</p>
<p>
The difference between the administration of
Algeria and that of Tunisia makes itself felt at
every step. In the one country it is the ruling
of a conquered people for the good of the conquerors
alone, and in the other it is the ruling of
an unconquered people by bolstering up and improving
their own institutions under the pretence
of seeking their welfare. The immense advantage
of the Tunisian system is apparent on all sides.
The expense is less, the excuses for irregularities
are greater, and the natives still remain a nominal
power in the land, instead of being considered as
near serfs as is permissible in this twentieth century.</p>
<p>
The results of the French occupation were
summed up to me by a Tunisian as the making
of roads, the introduction of more money and much
drunkenness, and the institution of laws which no
native could ever hope to understand. But France
has done more than that in Tunis, even for the
native. He has the benefit of protection for life
and property, with means of education and facilities
for travel, and an outlet for his produce. He might
do well&mdash;and there are many instances of commercial
success&mdash;but while he is jibbing against the foreign
yoke, the expatriated Jews, whom he treated so<a name="page320" id="page320"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;320]</span>
badly when he had the upper hand, are outstripping
him every day. The net result of the foreigners'
presence is good for him, but it would be much
better had he the sense to take advantage of his
chances as the Jew does. Many of the younger
generation, indeed, learn French, and enter the
great army of functionaries, but they are rigidly
restricted to the lowest posts, and here again the
Jew stands first.</p>
<p>
In business or agriculture there is sure to come
a time when cash is needed, so that French and
Jewish money-lenders flourish, and when the Tunisian
cannot pay, the merciless hand of foreign law
irresistibly sells him up. In the courts the complicated
procedure, the intricate code, and the swarm
of lawyers, bewilder him, and he sighs for the time
when a bribe would have settled the question, and
one did at least know beforehand which would win&mdash;the
one with the longer purse. Now, who
knows? But the Tunisian's principal occasions for
discontent are the compulsory military service, and
the multiplication and weight of the taxes. From
the former only those are exempt who can pass
certain examinations in French, and stiff ones at
that, so that Arabic studies are elbowed out; the
unremitted military duties during the Ramadán fast
are regarded as a peculiar hardship. To the taxes
there seems no end, and from them no way of
escape. Even the milkman complains, for example,
that though his goats themselves are taxed, he
cannot bring their food into town from his garden
without an additional charge being paid!</p>
<p>
With the superficial differences to be accounted
for by this new state of things, there still remains<a name="page321" id="page321"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;321]</span>
much more in Tunisia to remind one of Morocco
than in Algeria. What deeper distinctions there
are result in both countries from Turkish influence,
and Turkish blood introduced in the past, but even
these do not go very deep. Beneath it all there
are the foundations of race and creed common to all,
and the untouched countryman of Tunisia is closely
akin to his fellow of Morocco. Even in the towns
the underlying likeness is strong.</p>
<p>
The old city of Tunis is wonderfully like that
of Fez; the streets, the shops, the paving, being
identical; but in the former a picturesque feature
is sometimes introduced, stone columns forming
arcades in front of the shops, painted in spiral
bands of green and red, separated by a band of
white. The various trades are grouped there as
further west, and the streets are named after them.
The Mellah, or Jewish Quarter, has lost its boundary,
as at Tangier, and the gates dividing the various
wards have disappeared too. Hardly anything
remains of the city walls, new ones having arisen to
enclose the one European and two native suburbs.
But under a modern arcade in the main street, the
Avenue de France, there is between the shops the
barred gate leading to a mosque behind, which does
not look as if it were often opened.</p>
<p>
Tramways run round the line of the old walls,
and it is strange to see the natives jumping on and
off without stopping the car, in the most approved
western style. There, as in the trains, European
and African sit side by side, though it is to be
observed that as a rule, should another seat be free,
neither gets in where the other is. As for hopes
of encouraging any degree of amalgamation, these<a name="page322" id="page322"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;322]</span>
are vain indeed. A mechanical mixture is all that
can be hoped for: nothing more is possible. A
few French people have embraced Islám for worldly
aims, and it is popularly believed by the natives
that in England thousands are accepting Mohammed.</p>
<p>
The mosques of Tunis are less numerous than
those of Fez, but do not differ greatly from them
except in the inferior quality of the tile-work, and
in the greater use of stone for the arches and
towers. The latter are of the Moorish square
shape, but some, if not all, are ascended by steps,
instead of by inclined planes. The mosques, with
the exception of that at Kaïrwán&mdash;the most holy,
strange to say&mdash;are as strictly forbidden to Europeans
and Jews as in Morocco, and screens are put
up before the doors as in Tangier.</p>
<p>
The Moors are very well known in Tunis, so
many of them, passing through from Mekka on the
Hajj, have been prevented from getting home by
quarantine or lack of funds. Clad as a Moor myself,
I was everywhere recognized as from that country,
and was treated with every respect, being addressed
as "Amm el Háj" ("Uncle Pilgrim"), having my
shoulders and hands kissed in orthodox fashion.
There are several <i>cafés</i> where Morocco men are to
be met with by the score. One feature of this
cosmopolitan city is that there are distinct <i>cafés</i> for
almost every nation represented here except the
English.</p>
<p>
The Arabs of Morocco are looked upon as great
thieves, but the Sûsis have the highest reputation
for honesty. Not only are all the gate-keepers of
the city from that distant province, but also those
of the most important stores and houses, as well as<a name="page323" id="page323"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;323]</span>
of the railway-stations, and many are residents in
the town. The chief snake-charmers and story-tellers
also hail from Sûs.</p>
<p>
The veneration for Mulai Táïb of Wazzán, from
whom the shareefs of that place are descended, is
great, and the Aïsáwa, hailing from Mequinez, are
to be met with all along this coast; they are
especially strong at Kaïrwán. In Tunis, as also in
Algeria and Tripoli, the comparative absence of any
objection to having pictures taken of human beings,
which is an almost insurmountable hindrance in
Morocco, again allowed me to use my kodak frequently,
but I found that the Jews had a strong
prejudice against portraits.</p>
<p>
The points in which the domestic usages of
Tunisia differ from those of Morocco are the more
striking on account of the remarkably minute
resemblance, if not absolute identity, of so very
many others, and as the novelty of the innovations
wears off, it is hard to realize that one is not still in
the "Far West."</p>
<p>
In a native household of which I found myself
temporarily a member, it was the wholesale assimilation
of comparatively trivial foreign matters which
struck me. Thus, for instance, as one of the sons
of my host remarked&mdash;though he was dressed in a
manner which to most travellers would have appeared
exclusively oriental&mdash;there was not a thing upon
him which was not French. Doubtless a closer examination
of his costume would have shown that
some of the articles only reached him through French
hands, but the broad fact remained that they were
all foreign. It is in this way that the more civilized
countries show a strong and increasing tendency to<a name="page324" id="page324"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;324]</span>
develop into nations of manufacturers, with their
gigantic workshops forcing the more backward,
<i>nolens volens</i>, to relapse to the more primitive condition
of producers of raw material only.</p>
<p>
There was, of course, a time when every garment
such a man would have worn would have been of
native manufacture, without having been in any
feature less complete, less convenient, or less artistic
than his present dress. In many points, indeed,
there is a distinct loss in the more modern style,
especially in the blending of colours, while it is
certain that in no point has improvement been
made. My friend, for instance, had the addition,
common there, of a pair of striped merino socks,
thrust into a pair of rubber-soled tennis shoes.
Underneath he wore a second pair of socks, and
said that in winter he added a third. Above them
was not much bare leg, for the pantaloons are cut
there so as often to reach right down to the ankles.
This is necessitated by the custom of raising the
mattresses used for seats on divans, and by sitting
at table on European chairs with the legs dangling
in the cold. The turban has nothing of the gracefulness
of its Moorish counterpart, being often of a
dirty-green silk twisted into a rope, and then bound
round the head in the most inelegant fashion, sometimes
showing the head between the coils; they are
not folds. Heads are by no means kept so carefully
shaved as in Morocco, and I have seen hair
which looked as though only treated with scissors,
and that rarely.</p>
<p>
The fashion for all connected with the Government
to wear European dress, supplemented by the
"Fez" (fortunately not the Turkish style), brings<a name="page325" id="page325"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;325]</span>
about most absurd anomalies. This is especially
observable in the case of the many very stout
individuals who waddle about like ducks in their
ungainly breeches. I was glad to find on visiting
the brother of the late Bey that he retained the
correct costume, though the younger members of
his family and all his attendants were in foreign
guise. The Bey himself received me in the frock-coat
with pleated skirt, favoured by his countrymen
the Turks.</p>

<b>A TUNISIAN JEWESS IN STREET DRESS.</b>
</p><br /><br />

<p>
The Mohammedan women seen in the streets
generally wear an elegant fine silk and wool haïk
over a costume culminating in a peaked cap, the
face being covered&mdash;all but the eyes&mdash;by two black
handkerchiefs, awful to behold, like the mask of a
stage villain. More stylish women wear a larger
veil, which they stretch out on either side in front
of them with their hands. They seem to think
nothing of sitting in a railway carriage opposite a
man and chatting gaily with him. I learn from
an English lady resident in Tunis that the indoor
costume of the women is much that of the Jewesses
out of doors&mdash;extraordinary indeed. It is not
every day that one meets ladies in the street in
long white drawers, often tight, and short jackets,
black or white, but this is the actual walking dress
of the Jewish ladies of Tunis.</p>

<h3>XXXIV</h3>

<h2>TRIPOLI VIEWED FROM MOROCCO</h2>

<p class="center1">
"Every sheep hangs by her own legs."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
When, after an absence of twenty months, I found
myself in Tripoli, although far enough from Morocco,
I was still amid familiar sights and sounds which
made it hard to realize that I was not in some
hitherto unvisited town of that Empire. The petty
differences sank to naught amid the wonderful
resemblances. It was the Turkish element alone
which was novel, and that seemed altogether out of
place, foreign as it is to Africa. There was something
quite incongruous in the sight of those ungainly
figures in their badly fitting, quasi-European
black coats and breeches, crowned with tall and
still more ungainly red caps. The Turks are such
an inferior race to the Berbers and Arabs that it is
no wonder that they are despised by the natives.
They appear much more out of place than do the
Europeans, who remain, as in Morocco, a class by
themselves. To see a Turk side by side with a
white-robed native at prayer in a mosque is too
ridiculous, and to see him eating like a wild man
of the woods! Even the governor, a benign
old gentleman, looked very undignified in his
shabby European surroundings, after the important<a name="page327" id="page327"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;327]</span>
appearance of the Moorish functionaries in their
flowing robes. The sentinels at the door seemed to
have been taught to imitate the wooden salute of
the Germans, which removes any particle of grace
which might have remained in spite of their clumsy
dress. It is a strange sight to see them selling
their rations of uninviting bread in the market to
buy something more stimulating. They squat
behind a sack on the ground as the old women do
in Tangier. These are the little things reminding
one that Tripoli is but a Turkish dependency.</p>
<p>
We may complain of the Moorish customs
arrangements, but from my own experience, and
from what others tell me, I should say that here is
worse still. Not only were our things carefully
overhauled, but the books had to be examined, as a
result of which process Arabic works are often confiscated,
either going in or out. The confusing lack
of a monetary system equals anything even in
southern Morocco, between which and this place
the poor despised "gursh" turns up as a familiar
link, not to be met with between Casablanca and
Tripoli.</p>
<p>
Perhaps the best idea of the town for those
readers acquainted with Morocco will be to call it a
large edition of Casablanca. The country round
is flat, the streets are on the whole fairly regular,
and wider than the average in this part of the
world. Indeed, carriages are possible, though not
throughout the town. A great many more flying
arches are thrown across the streets than we are
accustomed to further west, but upper storeys are
rare. The paving is of the orthodox Barbary style.</p>
<p>
The Tripolitan mosques are of a very different<a name="page328" id="page328"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;328]</span>
style from those of Morocco, the people belonging
to a different sect&mdash;the Hánafis&mdash;Moors,
Algerines and Tunisians being of the more rigorous
Málikis. Instead of the open courtyard surrounded
by a colonnade, here they have a perfectly
closed interior roofed with little domes, and lighted
by barred windows. The walls are adorned with
inferior tiles, mostly European, and the floors are
carpeted. Round the walls hang cheap glazed
texts from the Korán, and there is a general
appearance of tawdry display which is disappointing
after the chaste adornment of the finer Moorish
mosques, or even the rude simplicity of the poorer
ones. Orders may be obtained to view these buildings,
of which it is hardly necessary to say I availed
myself, in one case ascending also the minaret.
These minarets are much less substantial than those
of Morocco, being octangular, with protruding stone
balconies in something of the Florentine style,
reached by winding stairs. The exteriors are whitewashed,
the balconies being tiled, and the cupolas
painted green. Lamps are hung out at certain
feasts. As for the voice of the muédhdhin, it must
be fairly faint, since during the week I was there
I never heard it. In Morocco this would have
been an impossibility.</p>
<p>
The language, though differing in many minor
details from that employed in Morocco, presents no
difficulty to conversation, but it was sometimes
necessary to try a second word to explain myself.
The differences are chiefly in the names of common
things in daily use, and in common adjectives. The
music was identical with what we know in the "Far
West." Religious strictness is much less than in<a name="page329" id="page329"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;329]</span>
Morocco, the use of intoxicants being fairly general
in the town, the hours of prayer less strictly kept,
and the objection to portraits having vanished.
There seemed fewer women in the streets than in
Morocco, but those who did appear were for the
most part less covered up; there was nothing new
in the way the native women were veiled, only one
eye being shown&mdash;I do not now take the foreign
Turks into account.</p>
<p>
In the streets the absence of the better-class
natives is most noticeable; one sees at once that
Tripoli is not an aristocratic town like Fez, Tetuan,
or Rabat. The differences which exist between the
costumes observed and those of Morocco are almost
entirely confined to the upper classes. The poor
and the country people would be undistinguishable
in a Moorish crowd. Among the townsfolk stockings
and European shoes are common, but there
are no native slippers to equal those of Morocco,
and yellow ones are rare. I saw no natives riding
in the town; though in the country it must be
more common. The scarcity of four-footed beasts
of burden is noticeable after the crowded Moorish
thoroughfares.</p>
<p>
On the whole there is a great lack of the picturesque
in the Tripoli streets, and also of noise. The
street cries are poor, being chiefly those of vegetable
hawkers, and one misses the striking figure of the
water-seller, with his tinkling bell and his cry.</p>
<p>
The houses and shops are much like those of
Morocco, so far as exteriors go, and so are the
interiors of houses occupied by Europeans. The
only native house to which I was able to gain
access was furnished in the worst possible mixture<a name="page330" id="page330"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;330]</span>
of European and native styles to be found in many
Jewish houses in Morocco, but from what I gleaned
from others this was no exception to the rule.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately the number of grog-shops is unduly
large, with all their attendant evils. The
wheeled vehicles being foreign, claim no description,
though the quaintness of the public ones is great.
Palmetto being unknown, the all-pervading halfah
fibre takes its place for baskets, ropes, etc. The
public ovens are very numerous, and do not differ
greatly from the Moorish, except in being more
open to the street. The bread is much less tempting;
baked in small round cakes, varnished, made
yellow with saffron, and sprinkled with gingelly
seed. Most of the beef going alive to Malta,
mutton is the staple animal food; vegetables are
much the same as in Morocco.</p>
<p>
The great drawback to Tripoli is its proximity
to the desert, which, after walking through a belt
of palms on the land side of the town&mdash;itself built
on a peninsula&mdash;one may see rolling away to the
horizon. The gardens and palm groves are watered
by a peculiar system, the precious liquid being
drawn up from the wells by ropes over pulleys, in
huge leather funnels of which the lower orifice is
slung on a level with the upper, thus forming a bag.
The discharge is ingeniously accomplished automatically
by a second rope over a lower pulley, the
two being pulled by a bullock walking down an
incline. The lower lip being drawn over the lower
pulley, releases the water when the funnel reaches
the top.</p>
<p>
The weekly market, Sôk et-Thláthah, held on
the sands, is much as it would be in the Gharb el<a name="page331" id="page331"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;331]</span>
Jawáni, as Morocco is called in Tripoli. The
greater number of Blacks is only natural, especially
when it is noted that hard by they have a large
settlement.</p>

<p>
It would, of course, be possible to enter into a
much more minute comparison, but sufficient has
been said to give a general idea of Tripoli to those
who know something of Morocco, without having
entered upon a general description of the place.
From what I saw of the country people, I have no
doubt that further afield the similarity between them
and the people of central and southern Morocco,
to whom they are most akin, would even be
increased.</p>

"Every one buries his mother as he likes."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>


<h4>I. <span class="sc">First Impressions</span>.</h4>

<p>
Much as I had been prepared by the accounts of
others to observe the prevalence of Moorish remains
in the Peninsula, I was still forcibly struck at every
turn by traces of their influence upon the country,
especially in what was their chief home there,
Andalucia. Though unconnected with these traces,
an important item in strengthening this impression
is the remarkable similarity between the natural
features of the two countries. The general contour
of the surface is the same on either side of the
straits for a couple of hundred miles; the same
broad plains, separated by low ranges of hills, and
crossed by sluggish, winding streams, fed from
distant snow-capped mountains, and subject to
sudden floods. The very colours of the earth are
the same in several regions, the soil being of that
peculiar red which gives its name to the Blád
Hamrá ("Red Country") near Marrákesh. This
is especially observable in the vicinity of Jeréz,
and again at Granáda, where one feels almost in<a name="page333" id="page333"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;333]</span>
Morocco again. Even the colour of the rugged
hills and rocks is the same, but more of the soil is
cultivated than in any save the grain districts of
Morocco.</p>
<p>
The vegetation is strikingly similar, the aloe and
the prickly pear, the olive and the myrtle abounding,
while from the slight glimpses I was able to
obtain of the flora, the identity seems also to be
continued there. Yet all this, though interesting
to the observer, is not to be wondered at. It is our
habit of considering the two lands as if far apart,
because belonging to separate continents, which
leads us to expect a difference between countries
divided only by a narrow gap of fourteen miles or
less, but one from whose formation have resulted
most important factors in the world's history.</p>
<p>
The first striking reminders of the Moorish
dominion are the names of Arabic origin. Some
of the most noteworthy are Granáda (Gharnátah),
Alcazar (El Kasar), Arjona (R'honah), Gibraltar
(Gibel Tárik), Trafalgár (Tarf el Gharb, "West
Point"), Medinah (Madînah, "Town"), Algeciras
(El Jazîrah, "The Island"), Guadalquivir (Wád el
Kebeer&mdash;so pronounced in Spain&mdash;"The Great
River"), Mulahacen (Mulai el Hasan), Alhama
(El Hama, "The Hot Springs"), and numberless
others which might be mentioned, including almost
every name beginning with "Al."</p>
<p>
The rendering of these old Arabic words
into Spanish presents a curious proof of the
changes which the pronunciation of the Spanish
alphabet has undergone during the last four centuries.
To obtain anything like the Arabic sound
it is necessary to give the letters precisely the same<a name="page334" id="page334"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;334]</span>
value as in English, with the exception of pronouncing
"x" as "sh." Thus the word "alhaja,"
in everyday use&mdash;though unrecognizable as heard
from the lips of the modern Castilian, "aláha,"&mdash;is
nothing but the Arabic "el hájah," with practically
the same meaning in the plural, "things" or
"goods." To cite more is unnecessary. The
genuine pronunciation is still often met with among
Jews of Morocco who have come little in contact
with Spaniards, and retain the language of
their ancestors when expelled from the Peninsula,
as also in Spanish America.</p>
<p>
The Spanish language is saturated with corrupted
Arabic, at all events so far as nouns are
concerned. The names of families also are frequently
of Arabic origin, as, for instance, Alarcos
(Er-Rakkás&mdash;"the courier"), Alhama, etc., most of
which are to be met with more in the country than
in the towns, while very many others, little suspected
as such, are Jewish. Although when the
most remarkable of nations was persecuted and
finally expelled from Spain, a far larger proportion
nobly sacrificed their all rather than accept the
bauble religion offered them by "The Catholic
Kings" (King and Queen), they also have left
their mark, and many a noble family could, if it
would, trace its descent from the Jews. Some of
their synagogues are yet standing, notably at
Toledo&mdash;whence the many Toledános,&mdash;built by
Samuel Levy, who was secretary to Don Pedro
the Cruel. This was in 1336, a century and a half
before the Moors were even conquered, much less
expelled, and if the sons of Ishmael have left their
mark upon that sunny land, so have the sons of<a name="page335" id="page335"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;335]</span>
Israel, though in a far different manner. Morocco
has ever since been the home of the descendants of
a large proportion of the exiles.</p>
<p>
The Spanish physiognomy, not so much of the
lower as of the upper classes, is strikingly similar
to that of the mountaineers of Morocco, and these
include some of the finest specimens. The Moors
of to-day are of too mingled a descent to present
any one distinct type of countenance, and it is the
same with the Spaniards. So much of the blood of
each flows in the veins of the other, that comparison
is rendered more difficult. It is a well-known fact
that several of the most ancient families in the
kingdom can trace their descent from Mohammedans.
A leading instance of this is the house
of Mondéjar, lords of Granáda from the time of
its conquest, as the then head of the house,
Sidi Yahia, otherwise Don Pedro de Granáda,
had become a Christian. In the Generalife at that
town, still in the custody of the same family, is a
genealogical tree tracing its origin right back to
the Goths!<a name="XXXV1r" id="XXXV1r"></a><a href="#XXXV1"><sup>*</sup></a></p>
<p>
Next to physiognomy come habits and customs,
and of these there are many which have been
borrowed, or rather retained, from the Moors,
especially in the country. The ploughs, the water-mills,
the water-wheels, the irrigation, the treading
out of the corn, the weaving of coarse cloth, and
many other daily sights, from their almost complete
similarity, remind one of Morocco. The bread-shops
they call "tahônas," unaware that this is the
Arabic for a flour-mill; their water-wheels they
still call by their Arabic name, "naôrahs," and it is<a name="page336" id="page336"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;336]</span>
the same with their pack-saddles, "albardas" (bardah).
The list might be extended indefinitely,
even from such common names as these.</p>
<p>
The salutations of the people seem literal translations
of those imported from the Orient, such as
I am not aware of among other Europeans. What,
for instance, is "Dios guarda Vd." ("God keep
you"), said at parting, but the "Allah îhannak" of
Morocco, or "se lo passe bien," but "B'is-salámah"
("in peace!"). More might be cited, but to those
unacquainted with Arabic they would be of little
interest.</p>
<p>
Then, again, the singing of the country-folk in
southern Spain has little to distinguish it from that
indulged in by most Orientals. The same sing-song
drawl with numerous variations is noticeable
throughout. Once a more civilized tune gets
among these people for a few months, its very composer
would be unlikely to recognize its prolongations
and lazy twists.</p>
<p>
The narrow, tortuous streets of the old towns
once occupied by the invaders take one back across
the straits, and the whole country is covered with
spots which, apart from any remains of note, are
associated by record or legend with anecdotes from
that page of Spanish history. Here it is the "Sigh
of the Moor," the spot from which the last Ameer
of Andalucia gazed in sorrow on the capital that he
had lost; there it is a cave (at Criptana) where the
Moors found refuge when their power in Castile
was broken; elsewhere are the chains (in Toledo)
with which the devotees of Islám chained their
Christian captives.</p>
<p>
In addition to this, the hills of a great part<a name="page337" id="page337"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;337]</span>
of Spain are dotted with fortresses of "tabia"
(rammed earth concrete) precisely such as are occupied
still by the country kaïds of Morocco; and by
the wayside are traces of the skill exercised in
bringing water underground from the hills beyond
Marrákesh. How many church towers in Spain
were built for the call of the muédhdhin, and how
many houses had their foundations laid for hareems!
In the south especially such are conspicuous from
their design. To crown all stand the palaces and
mosques of Córdova, Sevílle, and Granáda, not to
mention minor specimens.</p>
<p>
When we talk of the Moors in Spain, we often
forget how nearly we were enabled to speak also of
the Moors in France. Their brave attempts to
pass that natural barrier, the Pyrenees, find a suitable
monument in the perpetual independence of
the wee republic of Andorra, whose inhabitants so
successfully stemmed the tide of invasion. The
story of Charles Martel, too, the "Hammer" who
broke the Muslim power in that direction, is one
of the most important in the history of Europe.
What if the people who were already levying taxes
in the districts of Narbonne and Nîmes had found
as easy a victory over the vineyards of southern
France, as they had over those of Spain? Where
would they have stopped? Would they ever have
been driven out, or would St. Paul's have been a
second Kûtûbîya, and Westminster a Karûeeïn?
God knows!</p>

<h4>II. <span class="sc">Córdova</span></h4>

<p>
The earliest notable monument of Moorish
dominion in Andalucia still existing is the famous
mosque of Córdova, now deformed into a cathedral.
Its erection occupied the period from 786 to 796
of the Christian era, and it is said that it stands
on the site of a Gothic church erected on the ruins
of a still earlier temple dedicated to Janus. Portions,
however, have been added since that date, as inscriptions
on the walls record, and the European
additions date from 1521, when, notwithstanding
the protests of the people of Córdova, the bishops
obtained permission from Charles V. to rear the
present quasi-Gothic structure in its central court.
The disgust and anger which the lover of Moorish
architecture&mdash;or art of any sort&mdash;feels for the name
of "<i>Carlos quinto</i>," as at point after point hideous
additions to the Moorish remains are ascribed to
that conceited monarch, are somewhat tempered for
once by the record that even he repented when he
saw the result of his permission in this instance.
"You have built here," he said, "what you might
have built anywhere, and in doing so you have
spoiled what was unique in the world!" In each
of the three great centres of Moorish rule, Sevílle,
Granáda and Córdova, the same hand is responsible
for outrageous modern erections in the midst of
hoary monuments of eastern art, carefully inscribed
with their author's name, as "Cæsar the Emperor,
Charles the Fifth."</p>
<p>
The Córdova Mosque, antedated only by those
of Old Cairo and Kaïrwán, is a forest of marble<a name="page339" id="page339"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;339]</span>
pillars, with a fine court to the west, surrounded
by an arcade, and planted with orange trees and
palms, interspersed with fountains. Nothing in
Morocco can compare with it save the Karûeeïn
mosque at Fez, built a century later, but that building
is too low, and the pillars are for the most part
mere brick erections, too short to afford the elegance
which here delights. This is grand in its simplicity;
nineteen aisles of slightly tapering columns of beautiful
marbles, jasper or porphyry, about nine feet in
height, supporting long vistas of flying horse-shoe
arches, of which the stones are now coloured
alternately yellow and red, though probably intended
to be all pure white. Other still more
elegant scolloped arches, exquisitely decorated by
carving the plaster, spring between alternate pillars,
and from arch to arch, presumably more modern
work.</p>
<p>
The aisles are rather over twenty feet in width,
and the thirty-three cross vaultings about half as
much, while the height of the roof is from thirty to
forty feet. In all, the pillars number about 500,
though frequently stated to total 850 out of an
original 1419, but it is difficult to say where all
these can be, since the sum of 33 by 19 is only
627, and a deduction has to be made for the
central court, in which stands the church or choir.
Since these notes were first published, in 1890, I
have seen it disputed between modern impressionist
writers which of them first described the wonderful
scene as a palm grove, a comparison of which I had
never heard when I wrote, but the wonder to me
would be if any one could attempt to picture the
scene without making use of it.</p>

<a name="page340" id="page340"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;340]</span>
<p>
Who but a nation of nomads, accustomed to
obey the call to prayer beneath the waving branches
of African and Arabian palm-groves, would have
dreamed of raising such a House of God? Unless
for the purpose of supporting a wide and solid roof,
or of dividing the centre into the form of a cross,
what other ecclesiastical architects would have conceived
the idea of filling a place of worship with
pillars or columns? No one who has walked in a
palm-grove can fail to be struck by the resemblance
to it of this remarkable mosque. The very tufted
heads with their out-curving leaves are here reproduced
in the interlacing arches, and with the light
originally admitted by the central court and the
great doors, the present somewhat gloomy area
would have been bright and pleasant as a real
grove, with its bubbling fountains, and the soothing
sound of trickling streams. I take the present skylights
to be of modern construction, as I never saw
such a device in a Moorish building.</p>
<p>
Most of the marble columns are the remains of
earlier erections, chiefly Roman, like the bridge over
the Guadalquivir close by, restored by the builder
of the mosque. Some, indeed, came from Constantinople,
and others were brought from the south
of France. They are neither uniform in height nor
girth&mdash;some having been pieced at the bottom, and
others partly buried;&mdash;so also with the capitals,
certain of which are evidently from the same source
as the pillars, while the remainder are but rude
imitations, mostly Corinthian in style. The original
expenses of the building were furnished by a fifth of
the booty taken from the Spaniards, with the subsidies
raised in Catalonia and Narbonne. The<a name="page341" id="page341"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;341]</span>
Moors supplied voluntary, and European captives
forced labour.</p>

<p>
On Fridays, when the Faithful met in thousands
for the noon-day prayer, what a sight and what a
melody! The deep, rich tones of the organ may
add impressiveness to a service of worship, but there
is nothing in the world so grand, so awe-inspiring
as the human voice. When a vast body of males
repeats the formulæ of praise, together, but just
slightly out of time, the effect once heard is never
forgotten. I have heard it often, and as I walk
these aisles I hear it ringing in my ears, and can
picture to myself a close-packed row of white-robed
figures between each pillar, and rows from end to
end between, all standing, stooping, or forehead on
earth, as they follow the motions of the leader before
them. A grand sight it is, whatever may be one's
opinion of their religion. In the manner they sit
on the matted floors of their mosques there would
be room here for thirteen thousand without using
the Orange Court, and there is little doubt that on
days when the Court attended it used to be filled to
its utmost.</p>
<p>
To the south end of the cathedral the floor of
two wide aisles is raised on arches, exactly opposite
the niche which marks the direction of Mekka, and
the space above is more richly decorated than any
other portion of the edifice except the niche itself.
This doubtless formed the spot reserved for the
Ameer and his Court, screened off on three sides
to prevent the curiosity of the worshippers overcoming
their devotion, as is still arranged in
the mosques which the Sultan of Morocco attends
in his capitals. Until a few years ago this rich<a name="page342" id="page342"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;342]</span>
work in arabesque and tiles was hidden by
plaster.</p>
<p>
The kiblah niche is a gem of its kind. It
consists of a horse-shoe arch, the face of which
is ornamented with gilded glass mosaic, forming the
entrance to a semi-circular recess beautifully adorned
with arabesques and inscriptions, the top of the
dome being a large white marble slab hollowed out
in the form of a pecten shell. The wall over the
entrance is covered with texts from the Korán,
forming an elegant design, and on either side are
niches of lesser merit, but serving to set off the
central one which formed the kiblah. Eleven
centuries have elapsed since the hands of the
workmen left it, and still it stands a witness of
the pitch of art attained by the Berbers in Spain.</p>
<p>
It is said that here was deposited a copy of the
Korán written by Othmán himself, and stained with
his blood, of such a size that two men could
hardly lift it. When, for a brief period, the town
fell into the hands of Alfonso VII., his soldiers used
the mosque as a stable, and tore up this valuable
manuscript. When a Moorish Embassy was sent
to Madrid some years ago, the members paid a
visit to this relic of the greatness of their forefathers,
and to the astonishment of the custodians,
having returned to the court-yard to perform the
required ablutions, re-entered, slippers in hand, to
go through the acts of worship as naturally as
if at home. What a strange sight for a Christian
cathedral! Right in front of the niche is a plain
marble tomb with no sign but a plain bar dexter.
Evidently supposing this to be the resting-place of
some saint of their own persuasion, they made the<a name="page343" id="page343"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;343]</span>
customary number of revolutions around it. It would
be interesting to learn from their lips what their
impressions were.</p>
<p>
Of the tower which once added to the imposing
appearance of the building, it is recorded that it had
no rival in height known to the builders. It was of
stone, and, like one still standing in Baghdád from
the days of Harûn el Rasheed, had two ways to the
top, winding one above the other, so that those
who ascended by the one never met those descending
by the other. According to custom it was
crowned by three gilded balls, and it had fourteen
windows. This was of considerably later date than
the mosque itself, but has long been a thing of
the past.</p>
<p>
The European additions to the Córdova mosque
are the choir, high altar, etc., which by themselves
would make a fine church, occupying what must
have been originally a charming court, paved with
white marble and enlivened by fountains; the
tower, built over the main entrance, opening into
the Court of Oranges; and a score or two of
shrines with iron railings in front round the sides,
containing altars, images, and other fantastic baubles
to awe the ignorant. An inscription in the tower
records that it was nearly destroyed by the earth-quake
of 1755, and though it is the least objectionable
addition, it is a pity that it did not fall on that
or some subsequent occasion. It was raised on
the ruins of its Moorish predecessor in 1593. The
chief entrance, like that of Sevílle, is a curious
attempt to blend Roman architecture with Mauresque,
having been restored in 1377, but the result
is not bad. Recent "restorations" are observable<a name="page344" id="page344"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;344]</span>
in some parts of the mosque, hideous with colour,
but a few of the original beams are still visible.
I am inclined to consider the greater part of the
roof modern, but could not inspect it closely enough
to be certain. Though vaulted inside, it is tiled
in ridges in the usual Moorish style, but very few
green tiles are to be seen.</p>
<p>
From the tower the view reminds one strongly
of Morocco. The hills to the north and south,
with the river winding close to the town across the
fertile plain, give the scene a striking resemblance
to that from the tower of the Spanish consulate
at Tetuan. All around are the still tortuous streets
of a Moorish town, though the roofs of the houses
are tiled in ridges of Moorish pattern, as those
of Tangier were when occupied by the English
two hundred years ago, and as those of El K'sar
are now.</p>
<p>
The otherwise Moorish-looking building at one's
feet is marred by the unsightly erection in the
centre, and its court-yard seems to have degenerated
into a play-ground, where the neighbours saunter
or fill pitchers from the fountains.</p>
<p>
After enduring the apparently unceasing din
of the bells in those erstwhile stations of the muédhdhin,
one ceases to wonder that the lazy Moors
have such a detestation for them, and make use
instead of the stirring tones of the human voice.
Rest and quiet seem impossible in their vicinity,
for their jarring is simply head-splitting. And as
if they were not excruciating enough, during "Holy
Week" they conspire against the ear-drums of
their victims by revolving a sort of infernal machine
made of wood in the form of a hollow cross, with<a name="page345" id="page345"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;345]</span>
four swinging hammers on each arm which strike
against iron plates as the thing goes round. The
keeper's remark that the noise was awful was
superfluous.</p>
<p>
The history of the town of Córdova has been
as chequered as that of most Andalucian cities.
Its foundation is shrouded in obscurity. The
Romans and Vandals had in turn been its masters
before the Moors wrested it from the Spaniards
in the year 710 <span class="sc">a.d.</span> Though the Spaniards regained
possession of it in 1075, it was not for long,
as it soon fell into the hands of the invaders once
more. The Spanish victors only left a Moorish
viceroy in charge, who proved too true a Berber
to serve against his countrymen, so he betrayed
his trust. In 1236 it was finally recovered by the
Spaniards, after five hundred and twenty-four years
of Moorish rule. Since that time the traces of that
epoch of its history have been gradually disappearing,
till there only remain the mutilated mosque, and
portions of the ancient palace, or of saint-houses
(as the side-chapel of the Church of St. Miguel),
and of a few dwellings. Since the first train
steamed to this ancient city, in 1859, the railway
has probably brought as many pilgrims to the
mosque as ever visited it from other motives in its
greatest days.</p>
<p>
The industry founded here by the Moors&mdash;that
of tanning&mdash;which has given its name to a trade
in several countries,<a name="XXXV2r" id="XXXV2r"></a><a href="#XXXV2"><sup>*</sup></a> seems to have gone with
them to Morocco, for though many of the old
tan-pits still exist by the river side, no leather of
any repute is now produced here. The Moorish<a name="page346" id="page346"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;346]</span>
water-mills are yet at work though, having been
repaired and renewed on the original model. These,
as at Granáda and other places, are horizontal wheels
worked from a small spout above, directly under
the mill-stone, such as is met with in Fez and
Tetuan.</p>

<h4>III. <span class="sc">Sevílle</span></h4>

<p>
In the Girálda tower of Sevílle I expected to
find a veritable Moorish trophy in the best state of
preservation, open to that minute inspection which
was impossible in the only complete specimen of
such a tower, the Kutûbîya, part of a mosque still
in use. Imagine, then, my regret on arriving at the
foot of that venerable monument, to find it "spick
and span," as if just completed, looking new and
tawdry by the side of the cathedral which has
replaced the mosque it once adorned. Instead of
the hoary antiquity to which the rich deep colour
of the stone of the sister towers in Morocco bears
witness in their weather-beaten glory, this one,
built, above the first few stone courses, of inch
pan-tiles, separated by a like thickness of mortar,
has the appearance of having been newly pointed
and rubbed down, while faded frescoes on the walls
testify to the barbarity of the conquerors of the
"barbarians."</p>
<p>
The delicate tracery in hewn stone which adds
so greatly to the beauty of the Morocco and
Tlemçen examples, is almost entirely lacking, while
the once tasteful horse-shoe windows are now
pricked out in red and yellow, with a hideous
modern balcony of white stone before each. The<a name="page347" id="page347"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;347]</span>
quasi-Moorish belfry is the most pardonable addition,
but to crown all is an exhibition of incongruity
which has no excuse. The original tile-faced turret
of the Moors, with its gilded balls, has actually been
replaced by a structure of several storeys, the first
of which is Doric, the second Ionic, and the third
Corinthian. Imagine this crowning the comely
severity of the solid Moorish structure without a
projecting ornament! But this is not all. Swinging
in gaunt uneasiness over the whole, stands a
huge revolving statue, supposed to represent Faith,
holding out in one hand a shield which catches the
wind, and causes it to act as a weather-vane.</p>
<p>
Such is the Girálda of the twentieth century,
and the guide-books are full of praises for the
restorer, who doubtless deserves great credit for
his skill in repairing the tower after it had suffered
severely from lightning, but who might have done
more towards restoring the original design, at all
events in the original portion. We read in "Raôd
el Kártás" that the mosque was finished and the
tower commenced in 1197, during the reign of
Mulai Yakûb el Mansûr, who commenced its sisters
at Marrákesh and Rabat in the same year. One
architect is recorded to have designed all three&mdash;indeed,
they have little uncommon in their design,
and have been once almost alike. Some assert
that this man was a Christian, but there is nothing
in the style of building to favour such a supposition.</p>
<p>
The plan is that of all the mosque towers of
Morocco, and the only tower of a mosque in actual
use which I have ascended in that country&mdash;one
at Mogador&mdash;was just a miniature of this. It is,
therefore, in little else than point of size that these<a name="page348" id="page348"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;348]</span>
three are remarkable. The similarity between these
and the recently fallen tower of St. Mark's at Venice
is most striking, both in design and in the method
of ascent by an inclined plane; while around the
Italian lakes are to be seen others of less size, but
strongly resembling these.</p>
<p>
All three are square, and consist of six to eight
storeys in the centre, with thick walls and vaulted
roof, surrounded by an inclined plane from base to
summit, at an angle which makes it easy walking,
and horses have been ridden up. The unfinished
Hassan Tower at Rabat having at one time become
a place of evil resort, the reigning ameer ordered
the way up to be destroyed, but it was found so
hard that only the first round was cut away, and
the door bricked up. Each ramp of the Girálda,
if I remember rightly, has its window, but in the
Hassan many are without light, though at least
every alternate one has a window, some of these
being placed at the corner to serve for two, while
here they are always in the centre. The Girálda
proper contains seven of these storeys, with thirty-five
ramps. To the top of the eighth storey, which
is the first addition, dating from the sixteenth
century, now used as a belfry, the height is about
220 feet. The present total height is a little over
300 feet.</p>
<p>
The original turret of the Girálda, similar to
that at Marrákesh, was destroyed in 1396 by a
hurricane. The additions were finished in 1598.
An old view, still in existence, and dating from the
thirteenth century, shows it in its pristine glory,
and there is another&mdash;Moorish&mdash;as old as the
tower itself.</p>

<a name="page349" id="page349"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;349]</span>
<p>
After all that I had read and heard of the
palace at Sevílle, I was more disappointed than
even in the case of the Girálda. Not only does
it present nothing imposing in the way of Moorish
architecture, but it has evidently been so much
altered by subsequent occupants as to have lost
much of its original charm. To begin with the
outside, instead of wearing the fine crumbling
appearance of the palaces of Morocco or Granáda,
this also had been all newly plastered till it looks
like a work of yesterday, and coloured a not unbecoming
red. Even the main entrance has a
Gothic inscription half way up, and though its
general aspect is that of Moorish work, on a
closer inspection, the lower part at least is seen to
be an imitation, as in many ways the unwritten
laws of that style have been widely departed from.
The Gothic inscription states that Don Pedro I.
built it in 1364.</p>
<p>
Inside, the general ground plan remains much
as built, but connecting doorways have been opened
where Moors never put them, and with the exception
of the big raised tank in the corner, there is nothing
African about the garden. Even the plan has been
in places destroyed to obtain rooms of a more suitable
width for the conveniences of European life.
The property is a portion of the Royal patrimony,
and is from time to time occupied by the reigning
sovereign when visiting Sevílle. A marble tablet
in one of these rooms tells of a queen having been
born there during the last century.</p>
<p>
Much of the ornamentation on the walls is of
course original, as well as some of the ceilings and
doors, but the "restorations" effected at various<a name="page350" id="page350"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;350]</span>
epochs have greatly altered the face of things.
Gaudy colours show up both walls and ceilings,
but at the same time greatly detract from their
value, besides which there are coarse imitations of
the genuine tile-work, made in squares, with lines
in relief to represent the joints, as well as patterns
painted on the plaster to fill up gaps in the designs.
Then, too, the most prominent parts of the ornamentation
have been disfigured by the interposition
of Spanish shields and coats-of-arms on tiles. The
border round the top of the dado is alternated with
these all the way round some of the rooms. To
crown all, certain of the fine old doors, resembling
a wooden patchwork, have been "restored" with
plaster-of-Paris. Some of the arabesques which
now figure on these walls were actually pillaged
from the Alhambra.</p>
<p>
Many of the Arabic inscriptions have been
pieced so as to render them illegible, and some
have been replaced upside down, while others tell
their own tale, for they ascribe glory and might to
a Spanish sovereign, Don Pedro the Cruel, instead
of to a "Leader of the Faithful." A reference to
the history of the country tells us that this ruler
"reconstructed" the palace of the Moors, while
later it was repaired by Don Juan II., before
Ferdinand and Isabella built their oratories within
its precincts, or Charles V., with his mania for "improving"
these monuments of a foreign dominion,
doubled it in size. For six centuries this work,
literally of spoliation, has been proceeding in the
hands of successive owners; what other result than
that arrived at, could be hoped for?</p>
<p>
When this is realized, the greater portion of<a name="page351" id="page351"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;351]</span>
the historic value of this palace vanishes, and its
original character as a Moorish palace is seen to
have almost disappeared. There still, however,
remains the indisputable fact, apparent from what
does remain of the work of its builders, that it was
always a work of art and a trophy of the skill of
its designers, those who have interfered with it
subsequently having far from improved it.</p>
<p>
According to Arab historians, the foundations
of this palace were laid in 1171 <span class="sc">a.d.</span> and it was
reconstructed between 1353 and 1364. In 1762
a fire did considerable damage, which was not
repaired till 1805. The inscriptions are of no
great historical interest. "Wa lá ghálib ílá Allah"&mdash;"there
is none victorious but God"&mdash;abounds
here, as at the Alhambra, and there are some very
neat specimens of the Kufic character.</p>
<p>
Of Moorish Sevílle, apart from the Girálda
and the Palace&mdash;El Kasar, corrupted into Alcazar&mdash;the
only remains of importance are the Torre
del Oro&mdash;Borj ed-Daheb&mdash;built in 1220 at the
riverside, close to where the Moors had their bridge
of boats, and the towers of the churches of SS.
Marcos and Marina. Others there are, built in
imitation of the older erections, often by Moorish
architects, as those of the churches of Omnium
Sanctorum, San Nicolas, Ermita de la Virgen, and
Santa Catalina. Many private houses contain
arches, pillars, and other portions of Moorish
buildings which have preceded them, such as are
also to be found in almost every town of southern
Spain. As late as 1565 the town had thirteen
gates more or less of Moorish origin, but these
have all long since disappeared.</p>

<a name="page352" id="page352"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;352]</span>
<p>
Sevílle was one of the first cities to surrender
to the Moors after the battle of Guadalete, <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 711,
and remained in their hands till taken by St.
Ferdinand after fifteen months' siege in 1248, six
years after its inhabitants had thrown off their
allegiance to the Emperor of Morocco, and formed
themselves into a sort of republic, and ten years
after the Moorish Kingdom of Granáda was founded.
It then became the capital of Spain till Charles V.
removed the Court to Valladolid.</p>

<br />

<h4>IV. <span class="sc">Granáda</span></h4>
<p>
"O Palace Red! From distant lands I have
come to see thee, believing thee to be a garden in
spring, but I have found thee as a tree in autumn.
I thought to see thee with my heart full of joy, but
instead my eyes have filled with tears."</p>
<p>
So wrote in the visitors' album of the Alhambra,
in 1876, an Arab poet in his native tongue, and
another inscription in the same volume, written by
a Moor some years before, remarks, "Peace be on
thee, O Granáda! We have seen thee and admired
thee, and have said, 'Praised be he who constructed
thee, and may they who destroyed thee receive
mercy.'"</p>
<p>
As the sentiments of members of the race of its
builders, these expressions are especially interesting;
but they can hardly fail to be shared to some extent
by visitors from eastern lands, of whatever nationality.
Although the loveliest monument of Moorish art in
Spain, and a specimen of their highest architectural
skill, destructions, mutilations, and restorations have<a name="page353" id="page353"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;353]</span>
wrought so much damage to it that it now stands,
indeed, "as a tree in autumn." It was not those
who conquered the Moors on whom mercy was
implored by the writer quoted&mdash;for they, Ferdinand
and Isabella, did their best to preserve their trophy&mdash;but
on such of their successors as Charles V.,
who actually planted a still unfinished palace right
among the buildings of this venerable spot, adjoining
the remains of the Alhambra, part of which it
has doubtless replaced.</p>
<p>
This unartistic Austrian styled these remains
"the ugly abominations of the Moors," and forthwith
proceeded to erect really ugly structures. But
the most unpardonable destroyers of all that the
Moors left beautiful were, perhaps, the French,
who in 1810 entered Granáda with hardly a blow,
and under Sebastian practically desolated the
palace. They turned it into barracks and storehouses,
as inscriptions on its walls still testify&mdash;notably
on the sills of the "Miranda de la Reina."
Ere they left in 1812, they even went so far as
to blow up eight of the towers, the remainder only
escaping through the negligence of an employee, and
the fuses were put out by an old Spanish soldier.</p>
<p>
The Spaniards having thus regained possession,
the commissioners appointed to look after it "sold
everything for themselves, and then, like good
patriots, reported that the invaders had left nothing."
After a brief respite in the care of an old woman,
who exhibited more sense in the matter than all
the generals who had perpetrated such outrages
upon it, the Alhambra was again desecrated by a
new Governor, who used it as a store of salt fish
for the galley slaves.</p>

<a name="page354" id="page354"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;354]</span>
<p>
While the old woman&mdash;Washington Irving's
"Tia Antonia"&mdash;was in possession, that famous
writer did more than any one to restore the ancient
fame of the palace by coming to stay there, and
writing his well-known account of his visit. Mr.
Forde, and his friend Mr. Addington, the British
Ambassador, helped to remind people of its existence,
and saved what was left. Subsequent civil
wars have, however, afforded fresh opportunities
of injury to its hoary walls, and to-day it stands a
mere wreck of what it once was.</p>
<p>
The name by which these buildings are now
known is but the adjective by which the Arabs
described it, "El Hamra," meaning "The Red,"
because of its colour outside. When occupied it
was known only as either "The Palace of Granáda,"
or "The Red Palace." The colour of the earth
here is precisely that of the plains of Dukála and
Marrákesh, and the buildings, being all constructed
of tabia, are naturally of that colour. In no part
of Spain could one so readily imagine one's self in
Morocco; indeed, it is hard to realize that one is
not there till the new European streets are reached.
In the palace grounds, apart from the fine carriage-drive,
with its seats and lamp-posts, when out of
sight of the big hotels and other modern erections,
the delusion is complete. Even in the town the
running water and the wayside fountains take one
back to Fez; and the channels underneath the
pavements with their plugs at intervals are only
Moorish ones repaired. On walking the crooked
streets of the part which formed the town of four
centuries ago, on every hand the names are Moorish.
Here is the Kaisarîya, restored after a fire in<a name="page355" id="page355"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;355]</span>
1843; there is the street of the grain fandaks, and
beyond is a hammám, now a dwelling-house.</p>
<p>
The site of the chief mosque is now the cathedral,
in the chief chapel of which are buried the
conquerors of Granáda. There lie Ferdinand and
Isabella in plain iron-bound leaden coffins&mdash;far
from the least interesting sights of the place&mdash;in
a spot full of memories of that contest which
they considered the event of their lives, and which
was indeed of such vital importance to the country.
The inscription on their marble tomb in the church
above tells how that the Moors having been conquered
and heresy stamped out (?), that worthy
couple took their rest. The very atmosphere of
the place seems charged with reminiscences of the
Moors and their successful foes, and here the spirits
of Prescott and Gayangos, the historians, seem to
linger still.</p>
<p>
On either side of the high altar are extremely
interesting painted carvings. On one is figured the
delivering up of the Alhambra. Ferdinand, Isabella
and Mendoza ride in a line, and the latter
receives the key in his gloved hand as the conquered
king offers him the ring end, followed by a
long row of captives. Behind the victors ride their
knights and dames. On the other the Moors and
Mooresses are seen being christened wholesale by
the monks, their dresses being in some respects
remarkably correct in detail, but with glaring defects
in others, just what might be expected from one
whose acquaintance with them was recent but
brief.</p>
<p>
Before these carvings kneel real likenesses of
the royal couple in wood, and on the massive<a name="page356" id="page356"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;356]</span>
square tomb in front they repose in alabaster. A
fellow-tomb by their side has been raised to the
memory of their immediate successors. In the
sacristry are to be seen the very robes of Cardinal
Mendoza, and his missal, with the sceptre and
jewel-case of Isabella, and the sword of Ferdinand,
while that of the conquered Bû Abd Allah is
on view elsewhere. Here, too, are the standards
unfurled on the day of the recapture, January 2,
1492, and a picture full of interest, recording the
adieux of "Boabdil" and Ferdinand, who, after
their bitter contest, have shaken hands and are
here falling on each other's necks.</p>
<p>
As a model of Moorish art, the palace of
Granáda, commenced in 1248, is a monument of
its latest and most refined period. The heavy and
comparatively simple styles of Córdova and Sevílle
are here amplified and refined, the result being the
acme of elegance and oriental taste. This I say
from personal acquaintance with the temples of the
far East, although those present a much more
gorgeous appearance, and are much more costly
erections, evincing a degree of architectural ability
and the possession of hoards of wealth beside
which what the builders of the Alhambra could
boast of was insignificant; nor do I attempt to compare
these interesting relics with the equally familiar
immensity of ancient masonry, or with the magnificent
work of the Middle Ages still existing in
Europe. These monuments hold a place of their
own, unique and unassailable. They are the
mementoes of an era in the history of Europe, not
only of the Peninsula, and the interest which
attaches itself to them even on this score alone<a name="page357" id="page357"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;357]</span>
is very great. As relics on a foreign soil, they
have stood the storms of five centuries under the
most trying circumstances, and the simplicity of
their components lends an additional charm to the
fabric. They are to a great extent composed of
what are apparently the weakest materials&mdash;mud,
gypsum, and wood; the marble and tiles are but
adornments.</p>
<p>
From without the appearance of the palace has
been well described as that of "reddish cork models
rising out of a girdle of trees." On a closer inspection
the "cork" appears like red sandstone, and one
wonders how it has stood even one good storm.
There is none of that facing of stone which gives
most other styles of architecture an appearance of
durability, and whatever facing of plaster it may
once have possessed has long since disappeared.
But inside all is different. Instead of crumbling
red walls, the courts and apartments are highly
ornamented with what we now call plaster-of-Paris,
but which the Moors have long prepared by roasting
the gypsum in rude kilns, calling it "gibs."</p>
<p>
A full description of each room or court-yard
would better become a guide-book, and to those
who have the opportunity of visiting the spot, I
would recommend Ford's incomparable "Handbook
to Spain," published by Murray, the older
the edition the better. To those who can read
Spanish, the "Estudio descriptivo de los Monumentos
arabes," by the late Sr. Contreras (Government
restorer of the Moorish remains in Spain), to
be obtained in Granáda, is well worth reading.
Such information as a visitor would need to correct
the mistaken impressions of these and other writers<a name="page358" id="page358"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;358]</span>
ignorant of Moorish usages as to the original
purpose of the various apartments, I have embodied
in Macmillan's "Guide to the Western
Mediterranean."</p>
<p>
Certain points, however, either for their architectural
merit or historic interest, cannot be passed
over. Such is the Court of the Lions, of part of
which a model disfigured by garish painting may be
seen at the Crystal Palace. In some points it is
resembled by the chief court of the mosque of the
Karûeeïn at Fez. In the centre is that strange
departure from the injunctions of the Korán which
has given its name to the spot, the alabaster fountain
resting on the loins of twelve beasts, called, by
courtesy, "lions." They remind one rather of cats.
"Their faces barbecued, and their manes cut like
the scales of a griffin, and the legs like bed-posts; a
water-pipe stuck in their mouths does not add to
their dignity." In the inscription round the basin
above, among flowery phrases belauding the
fountain, and suggesting that the work is so fine
that it is difficult to distinguish the water from the
alabaster, the spectator is comforted with the
assurance that they cannot bite!</p>
<p>
The court is surrounded by the usual tiled
verandah, supported by one hundred and twenty-two
light and elegant white marble pillars, the arches
between which show some eleven different forms.
At each end is a portico jutting out from the
verandahs, and four cupolas add to the appearance
of the roofs. The length of the court is twice its
width, which is sixty feet, and on each side lies a
beautiful decorated apartment with the unusual
additions of jets of water from the floor in the<a name="page359" id="page359"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;359]</span>
centre of each, as also before each of the three doors
apiece of the long narrow Moorish rooms, and under
the two porticoes. The overflows, instead of being
hidden pipes, are channels in the marble pavement,
for the Moors were too great lovers of rippling
water to lose the opportunity as we cold-blooded
northerners would.</p>
<p>
To fully realize the delights of such a place one
must imagine it carpeted with the products of Rabat,
surrounded by soft mattresses piled with cushions,
and with its walls hung with a dado of dark-coloured
felt cloths of various colours, interworked to represent
pillars and arches such as surround the gallery, and
showing up the beautiful white of the marble by contrast.
Thus furnished&mdash;in true Moorish style&mdash;the
place should be visited on a hot summer's day, after
a wearisome toil up the hill from the town. Then,
lolling among the cushions, and listening to the
splashing water, if strong sympathy is not felt
with the builders of the palace, who thought it a
paradise, the visitor ought never to have left his
armchair by the fire-side at home.</p>
<p>
If, instead of wasting money on re-plastering the
walls until they look ready for papering, and then
scratching geometrical designs upon them in a style
no Moor ever dreamed of, the Spanish Government
would entrust a Moor of taste to decorate it in his own
native style, without the modern European additions,
they would do far better and spend less. One step
further, and the introduction of Moorish guides and
caretakers who spoke Spanish&mdash;easy to obtain&mdash;would
add fifty per cent. to the interest of the place.
Then fancy the Christian and Muslim knights meeting
in single combat on the plains beneath those<a name="page360" id="page360"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;360]</span>
walls. People once more the knolls and pastures
with the turban and the helm, fill in the colours
of robe and plume; oh, what a picture it would
make!</p>
<p>
Doubtless similar apartments for the hareem
exist in the recesses of the palaces of Fez, Mequinez,
Marrákesh and Rabat. Some very fine
work is to be seen in the comparatively public
parts, in many respects equalling this, and certainly
better than that of the palace of Sevílle. Various
alterations and "restorations" have been effected
from time to time in this as in other parts of the
palace, notably in the fountain, the top part of
which is modern. It is probable that originally
there was only one basin, resting immediately on
the "lions" below. Its date is given as 1477 <span class="sc">a.d.</span></p>
<p>
The room known for disputed reasons as the
Hall of the Two Sisters was originally a bedroom.
The entrance is one of the most elaborate in the
palace, and its wooden ceiling, pieced to resemble
stalactites, is a charming piece of work, as also are
those of the other important rooms of the palace.</p>
<p>
Another apartment opening out of the Court of
Lions, known as the Hall of Justice&mdash;most likely in
error&mdash;contains one of the most curious remains in
the palace, another departure from the precepts of
the religion professed by its builders. This is no
less than a series of pictures painted on skins sewn
together, glued and fastened to the wooden dome
with tinned tacks, and covered with a fine coating
of gypsum, the gilt parts being in relief. Though
the date of their execution must have been in the
fourteenth century, the colours are still clear and
fresh. The picture in the centre of the three domes<a name="page361" id="page361"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;361]</span>
is supposed by some to represent ten Moorish kings
of Granáda, though it is more likely meant for ten
wise men in council. On the other two ceilings are
pictures, one of a lady holding a chained lion, on the
point of being delivered from a man in skins by a
European, who is afterwards slain by a mounted
Moor. The other is of a boar-hunt and people drinking
at a fountain, with a man up a tree in a dress
which looks remarkably like that of the eighteenth
century in England, wig and all. This work must
have been that of some Christian renegade, though
considerable discussion has taken place over the
authorship. It is most likely that the lions are of
similar origin, sculptured by some one who had but
a remote idea of the king of the forest.</p>
<p>
After the group of apartments surrounding the
Court of the Lions, the most valuable specimen of
Moorish architecture is that known as the Hall of
the Ambassadors, probably once devoted to official
interviews, as its name denotes. This is the largest
room in the palace, occupying the upper floor in one
of the massive towers which defended the citadel,
overlooking the Vega and the remains of the camp-town
of Santa Fé, built during the siege by the
"Catholic Kings." The thickness of its walls is
therefore immense, and the windows look like little
tunnels; under it are dungeons. The hall is thirty-seven
feet square, and no less than seventy-five feet
high in the centre of the roof, which is not the
original one. Some of the finest stucco wall decoration
in the place is to be seen here, with elegant
Arabic inscriptions, in the ancient style of ornamental
writing known as Kufic, most of the instances of the
latter meaning, "O God, to Thee be endless praise,<a name="page362" id="page362"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;362]</span>
and thanks ascending." Over the windows are
lines in cursive Arabic, ascribing victory and glory
to the "leader of the resigned, our lord the father of
the pilgrims" (Yûsef I.), with a prayer for his welfare,
while everywhere is to be seen here, as in other
parts, the motto, "and there is none victorious but
God."</p>
<p>
Between the two blocks already described lie
the baths, the undressing-room of which has been
very creditably restored by the late Sr. Contreras,
and looks splendid. It is, in fact, a covered patio
with the gallery of the next floor running round, and
as no cloth hangings or carpets could be used here,
the walls and floor are fully decorated with stucco
and tiles. The inner rooms are now in fair condition,
and are fitted with marble, though the boiler
and pipes were sold long ago by a former "keeper"
of the palace. The general arrangement is just the
same as that of the baths in Morocco.</p>
<p>
One room of the palace was fitted up by Ferdinand
and Isabella as a chapel, the gilt ornaments of
which look very gaudy by the side of the original
Moorish work. Opening out of this is a little gem
of a mosque, doubtless intended for the royal devotions
alone, as it is too small for a company.</p>
<p>
Surrounding the palace proper are several other
buildings forming part of the Alhambra, which must
not be overlooked. Among them are the two
towers of the Princesses and the Captives, both of
which have been ably repaired. In the latter are
to be seen tiles of a peculiar rosy tint, not met with
elsewhere. In the Dar Aïshah ("Gabinete de
Lindaraxa"&mdash;"x" pronounced as "sh") are excellent
specimens of those with a metallic hue, resembling<a name="page363" id="page363"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;363]</span>
the colours on the surface of tar-water. Ford points
out that it was only in these tiles that the Moors
employed any but the primary colours, with gold for
yellow. This is evident, and holds good to the
present day. Both these towers give a perfect
idea of a Moorish house of the better class in
miniature. Outside the walls are of the rough red of
the mud concrete, while inside they are nearly all
white, and beautifully decorated. The thickness of
the walls keeps them delightfully cool, and the
crooked passages render the courts in the centre
quite private.</p>
<p>
Of the other towers and gates, the only notable
one is that of Justice, a genuine Moorish erection
with a turning under it to stay the onrush of an
enemy, and render it easier of defence. The hand
carved on the outer arch and the key on the inner
one have given rise to many explanations, but their
only significance was probably that this gate was
the key of the castle, while the hand was to protect
the key from the effects of the evil eye. This
superstition is still popular, and its practice is to be
seen to-day on thousands of doors in Morocco, in
rudely painted hands on the doorposts.</p>
<p>
The Watch Tower (de la Vela) is chiefly noteworthy
as one of the points from which the Spanish
flag was unfurled on the memorable day of the
entry into Granáda. The anniversary of that date,
January 2nd, is a high time for the young ladies,
who flock here to toll the bell in the hopes of being
provided with a husband during the new-begun
year.</p>
<p>
At a short distance from the Alhambra itself is
a group known as the Torres Bermejas (Vermilion<a name="page364" id="page364"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;364]</span>
Towers), probably the most ancient of the Moorish
reign, if part did not exist before their settlement
here, but they present no remarkable architectural
features.</p>
<p>
Across a little valley is the Generalife, a charming
summer residence built about 1320, styled by its
builder the "Paradise of the Wise,"&mdash;Jinah el Arîf&mdash;which
the Spaniards have corrupted to its present
designation, pronouncing it Kheneraliffy. Truly
this is a spot after the Moor's own heart: a
luxuriant garden with plenty of dark greens against
white walls and pale-blue trellis-work, harmonious
at every turn with the rippling and splashing of
nature's choicest liquid. Of architectural beauty the
buildings in this garden have but little, yet as specimens
of Moorish style&mdash;though they have suffered
with the rest&mdash;they form a complement to the Alhambra.
That is the typical fortress-palace, the abode
of a martial Court; this is the pleasant resting-place,
the cool retreat for love and luxury. Nature is here
predominant, and Art has but a secondary place, for
once retaining her true position as great Nature's
handmaid. Light arched porticoes and rooms
behind serve but as shelter from the noonday glare,
while roomy turrets treat the occupier to delightful
views. Superfluous ornament within is not allowed
to interfere with the contemplation of beauty
without.</p>
<p>
Between the lower and upper terrace is a remarkable
arrangement of steps, a Moorish ideal, for
at equal distances from top to bottom, between each
flight, are fountains playing in the centre, round
which one must walk, while a stream runs down the
top of each side wall in a channel made of tiles.<a name="page365" id="page365"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;365]</span>
What a pleasant sight and sound to those to whom
stair climbing in a broiling sun is too much exercise!
The cypresses in the garden are very fine, but they
give none too much shade. The present owner's
agent has Bû Abd Allah's sword on view at his
house in the town, and this is a gem worth asking
to see when a ticket is obtained for the Generalife.
It is of a totally different pattern and style of ornament
from the modern Moorish weapons, being
inlaid in a very clever and tasteful manner.</p>
<p>
To the antiquary the most interesting part of
Granáda is the Albaycin, the quarter lying highest
up the valley of the Darro, originally peopled by
refugees from the town of Baeza&mdash;away to the
north, beyond Jaen&mdash;the Baïseeïn. As the last
stronghold of Moorish rule in the Peninsula, when
one by one the other cities, once its rivals, fell into
the hands of the Christians again, Granáda became
a centre of refuge from all parts, and to this owed
much of its ultimate importance.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately no attempt has been made to preserve
the many relics of that time which still exist
in this quarter, probably the worst in the town.
Many owners of property in the neighbourhood can
still display the original Arabic title deeds, their
estates having been purchased by Spanish grandees
from the expelled Moors, or later from the expelled
Jews. A morning's tour will reveal much of
interest in back alleys and ruined courts. One
visitor alone is hardly safe among the wild half-gipsy
lot who dwell there now, but a few copper
coins are all the keys needed to gain admission
to some fine old patios with marble columns,
crumbling fandaks, and ruined baths. By the<a name="page366" id="page366"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;366]</span>
roadside may be seen the identical style of water-mill
still used in Morocco, and the presence of the
Spaniard seems a dream.</p>

<br />

<h4>V. <span class="sc">Hither and Thither</span></h4>

<p>
Having now made pilgrimages to the more
famous homes of the Moor in Europe, let us in
fancy take an aërial flight over sunny Spain, and
glance here and there at the scattered traces of
Muslim rule in less noted quarters. Everything
we cannot hope to spy, but we may still surprise
ourselves and others by the number of our finds.
Even this task accomplished, a volume on the subject
might well be written by a second Borrow or a
Ford, whose residence among the modern Moors
had sharpened his scent for relics of that ilk.<a name="XXXV3r" id="XXXV3r"></a><a href="#XXXV3"><sup>*</sup></a> Let
not the reader think that with these wayside jottings
all has been disclosed, for the Moor yet lives
in Spain, and there is far more truth in the saying
that "Barbary begins at the Pyrenees" than is
generally imagined.</p>
<p>
We will start from Tarifa, perhaps the most
ancient town of Andalucia. The Moors named
this ancient Punic city after T'arîf ibn Málek ("The
Wise, son of King"), a Berber chief. They beleaguered
it about 1292, and it is still enclosed
by Moorish walls. The citadel, a genuine Moorish
castle, lies just within these walls, and was not so
long ago the abode of galley-slaves. Close to
Sevílle, where the river Guadalquivir branches off,<a name="page367" id="page367"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;367]</span>
it forms two islands&mdash;Islas Mayor y Menor. The
former was the Kaptal of the Moors. At Coria
the river winds under the Moorish "Castle of the
Cleft" (El Faraj), now called St. Juan de Alfarache,
and passes near the Torre del Oro, a monument
of the invader already referred to. Old Xeres, of
sherry fame, is a straggling, ill-built, ill-drained
Moorish city. It was taken from the Moors in
1264. Part of the original walls and gates remain
in the old town. The Moorish citadel is well preserved,
and offers a good specimen of those turreted
and walled palatial fortresses.</p>
<p>
But it is not till we reach Sevílle that we come
to a museum of Moorish antiquities. Here we see
Arabesque ceilings, marqueterie woodwork, stucco
panelling, and the elegant horse-shoe arches. There
are beautiful specimens in the citadel, in Calle
Pajaritos No. 15, in the Casa Prieto and elsewhere.
The Moors possessed the city for five hundred
years, during which time they entirely rebuilt it,
using the Roman buildings as materials. Many
Moorish houses still exist, the windows of which
are barricaded with iron gratings. On each side
of the patios, or courts, are corridors supported by
marble pillars, whilst a fountain plays in the centre.
These houses are rich in Moorish porcelain tilings,
called azulejos&mdash;from the Arabic ez-zulaïj&mdash;but the
best of these are in the patio of the citadel. Carmona
is not far off, with its oriental walls and
castle, famous as ever for its grateful springs. The
tower of San Pedro transports us again to Tangier,
as do the massy walls and arched gate.</p>
<p>
Some eight leagues on the way to Badajos from
Sevílle rises a Moorish tower, giving to the adjoining<a name="page368" id="page368"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;368]</span>
village the name of Castillo de las Guardias.
Five leagues beyond are the mines of the "Inky
River"&mdash;Rio Tinto&mdash;a name sufficiently expressive
and appropriate, for it issues from the mountain-side
impregnated with copper, and is consequently
corrosive. The Moors seem to have followed the
Romans in their workings on the north side of the
hill. Further on are more mines, still proclaiming
the use the Moors made of them by their present
name Almádin&mdash;"the Mine"&mdash;a name which has
almost become Spanish; it is still so generally used.
Five leagues from Rio Tinto, at Aracena, is another
Moorish castle, commanding a fine panorama, and
the belfry of the church hard by is Arabesque.</p>
<p>
Many more of these ruined kasbahs are to be
seen upon the heights of Andalucia, and even
much further north; but the majority must go unmentioned.
One, in an equally fine position, is to
be seen eleven leagues along the road from Sevílle
to Badajos, above Santa Olalla&mdash;a name essentially
Moorish, denoting the resting-place of some female
Mohammedan saint, whose name has been lost sight
of. (Lallah, or "Lady," is the term always prefixed
to the names of canonized ladies in Morocco.)
Three leagues from Sevílle on the Granáda road,
at Gandul, lies another of these castles, picturesquely
situated amid palms and orange groves; four
leagues beyond, the name Arahal (er-rahálah&mdash;"the
day's journey") reminds the Arabicist that it is
time to encamp; a dozen leagues further on the
name of Roda recalls its origin, raôdah, "the cemetery."
Riding into Jaen on the top of the diligence
from Granáda, I was struck with the familiar
appearance of two brown tabia fortresses above the<a name="page369" id="page369"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;369]</span>
town, giving the hillside the appearance of one of
the lower slopes of the Atlas. This was a place
after the Moors' own heart, for abundant springs
gush everywhere from the rocks. In their days it
was for a time the capital of an independent
kingdom.</p>
<p>
At Ronda, a town originally built by the Moors&mdash;for
Old Ronda is two leagues away to the north,&mdash;their
once extensive remains have been all but
destroyed. Its tortuous streets and small houses,
however, testify as to its origin, and its Moorish castle
still appears to guard the narrow ascent by which
alone it can be reached from the land, for it crowns a
river-girt rock. Down below, this river, the Guadalvin,
still turns the same rude class of corn-mills that
we have seen at Fez and Granáda. Other remnants
are another Moorish tower in the Calle del
Puente Viejo, and the "House of the Moorish
King" in Calle San Pedro, dating from about 1042.
Descending to the river's edge by a flight of stairs
cut in the solid rock, there is a grotto dug by
Christian slaves three centuries later. Some five
leagues on the road thence to Granáda are the
remains of the ancient Teba, at the siege of
which in 1328, when it was taken from the Moors,
Lord James Douglas fought in obedience to the
dying wish of the Bruce his master, whose heart
he wore in a silver case hung from his neck,
throwing it among the enemy as he rushed in
and fell.</p>
<p>
On the way from Ronda to Gibraltar are a
number of villages whose Arab names are startling
even in this land of Ishmaelitish memories. Among
these are Atajate, Gaucin, Benahali, Benarraba,<a name="page370" id="page370"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;370]</span>
Benadalid, Benalaurin. At Gaucin an excellent view
of Gibraltar and Jibel Mûsa is obtainable from its
Moorish citadel. This brings us to old "Gib," whose
relics of Tárîk and his successors are much better
known to travellers than most of those minor remains.
An inscription over the gate of the castle, now a
prison, tells of its erection over eleven centuries ago,
for this was naturally one of the early captures of
the invaders. Yet the mud-concrete walls stand firm
and sound, though scarred by many a shot. Algeciras&mdash;El
Jazîrah&mdash;"the Island" has passed through
too many vicissitudes to have much more than the
name left.</p>
<p>
Malaga, though seldom heard of in connection
with the history of Mohammedan rule in the Peninsula,
played a considerable part in that drama. It
and Cadiz date far back to the time of the Carthaginians,
so that, after all, their origin is African.
If its name is not of an earlier origin, it may be from
Málekah, "the Queen." Every year on August 18,
at 3 p.m. the great bell of the cathedral is struck
thrice, for that is the anniversary of its recovery
from the Aliens in 1487. The flag of Ferdinand
then hoisted is (or was recently) still to be seen,
together with a Moorish one, probably that of the
vanquished city, over the tomb of the Conde de
Buena Vista in the convent of La Victoria. Though
odd bits of Moorish architecture may still be met
with in places, the only remains of note are the
castle, built in 1279, with its fine horse-shoe gate&mdash;sadly
disfigured by modern barbarism&mdash;and what
was the dockyard of the Moors, now left high and
dry by the receding sea.</p>
<p>
The name Alhama, met with in several parts of<a name="page371" id="page371"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;371]</span>
Spain, merely denotes "the hot," alluding to springs
of that character which are in most instances still
active. This is the case at the Alhama between
Malaga and Granáda, where the baths are worth
a visit. The Moorish bath is called the strong
one, being nearer the spring.</p>
<p>
At Antequera the castle is Moorish, though
built on Roman foundations, and it is only of recent
years that the mosque has disappeared under the
"protection" of an impecunious governor.</p>
<p>
Leaving the much-sung Andalûs, the first name
striking us in Murcia is that of Guadíx (pronounced
Wadish), a corruption of Wád Aïsh, "River of Life."
Its Moorish castle still stands. Some ten leagues
further on, at Cullar de Baza is another Moorish
ruin, and the next of note, a fine specimen, is fifteen
leagues away at Lorca, whose streets are in the
genuine intricate style. The city of Murcia, though
founded by the Moors, contains little calling them
to remembrance. In the post-office and prison,
however, and in the public granary, mementoes are
to be found.</p>
<p>
Orihuela, on the road from Carthagena to
Alicante, still looks oriental with its palm-trees,
square towers and domes, and Elche is just another
such, with flat roofs and the orthodox kasbah, now
a prison. The enormous number of palms which
surround the town recall Marrákesh, but they are
sadly neglected. Monte Alegre is a small place
with a ruined Moorish castle, about fifteen leagues
from Elche on the road to Madrid. Between
Alicante and Xativa is the Moorish castle of Tibi,
close to a large reservoir, and there is a square
Moorish tower at Concentaina.  Xativa has a<a name="page372" id="page372"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;372]</span>
hermitage, San Felin, adorned with horse-shoe
arches, having a Moorish cistern hard by.</p>
<p>
Valencia the Moors considered a Paradise, and
their skill in irrigation has been retained, so that of
the Guadalaviar (Wad el Abîad&mdash;"River of the
Whites") the fullest use is made in agriculture, and
the familiar water-wheels and conduits go by the
corruptions of their Arabic names, naôrahs and
sakkáïahs. The city itself is very Moorish in
appearance, with its narrow tortuous streets and
gloomy buildings, but I know of no remarkable
legacy of the Moors there. There are the remains
of a Moorish aqueduct at Chestalgár&mdash;a very Arabic
sounding name, of which the last two syllables are
corrupted from El Ghárb ("the West") as in the
case of Trafalgár (Terf el Ghárb&mdash;"West Point").
All this district was inhabited by the Moriscos or
Christianized Moors as late as the beginning of
the seventeenth century, and there must their descendants
live still, although no longer distinguished
from true sons of the soil.</p>
<p>
Whatever may remain of the ancient Saguntum,
what is visible is mostly Moorish, as, for instance,
cisterns on the site of a Roman temple. Not far
from Valencia is Burjasot, where are yet to be seen
specimens of matmôrahs or underground granaries.
Morella is a scrambling town with Moorish walls
and towers, coroneted by a castle.</p>
<p>
Entering Catalonia, Tortosa, at the mouth of
the Ebro, is reached, once a stronghold of the
Moors, and a nest of pirates till recovered by
Templars, Pisans and Genoese together. It was
only withheld from the Moors next year by the
valour of the women besieged. The tower of the<a name="page373" id="page373"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;373]</span>
cathedral still bears the title of Almudena, a reminder
of the muédhdhin who once summoned
Muslims to prayer from its summit. Here, too, are
sundry remnants of Moorish masonry, and some
ancient matmôrahs.</p>
<p>
Tarragona and Barcelona, if containing no
Moorish ruins of note, have all, in common with
other neighbouring places, retained the Arabic name
Rambla (rimlah, "sand") for the quondam sandy
river beds which of late years have been transformed
into fashionable promenades. In the cathedral of
Tarragona an elegant Moorish arch is noticeable,
with a Kufic inscription giving the date as 960 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>
For four centuries after this city was destroyed by
Tarîf it remained unoccupied, so that much cannot
be expected to call to mind his dynasty. Of a
bridge at Martorell over the Llobregat, Ford says
it is "attributed to Hannibal by the learned, and to
the devil, as usual, by the vulgar. The pointed
centre arch, which is very steep and narrow to pass,
is 133 feet wide in the span, and is unquestionably
a work of the Moors." Not far away is a place
whose name, Mequineza, is strongly suggestive
of Moorish origin, but I know nothing further
about it.</p>
<p>
Now let us retrace our flight, and wing our way
once more to the north of Sevílle, to the inland
province of Estremadura. Here we start from
Mérida, where the Roman-Moorish "alcazar" towers
proudly yet. The Moors repaired the old Roman
bridge over the Guadiana, and the gateway near
the river has a marble tablet with an Arabic inscription.
The Muslims observed towards the
people of this place good faith such as was never<a name="page374" id="page374"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;374]</span>
shown to them in return, inasmuch as they allowed
them to retain their temples, creed, and bishops.
They built the citadel in 835, and the city dates
its decline from the time that Alonzo el Sabio took
it from them in 1229. Zámora is another ancient
place. It was taken from the Moors in 939, when
40,000 of them are said to have been killed. The
Moorish designs in the remarkable circular arches of
La Magdalena are worthy of note.</p>
<p>
In Toledo the church of Santo Tomé has a
brick tower of Moorish character; near it is the
Moorish bridge of San Martin, and in the neighbourhood,
by a stream leading to the Tagus,
Moorish mills and the ruins of a villa with Moorish
arches, now a farm hovel, may still be seen. The
ceiling of the chapel of the church of San Juan de
la Penetencia is in the Moorish style, much dilapidated
(1511 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>). The Toledan Moors were first-rate
hydraulists. One of their kings had a lake
in his palace, and in the middle a kiosk, whence
water descended on each side, thus enclosing
him in the coolest of summer-houses. It was in
Toledo that Ez-Zarkal made water-clocks for astronomical
calculations, but now this city obtains its
water only by the primitive machinery of donkeys,
which are driven up and down by water-carriers as
in Barbary itself. The citadel was once the kasbah
of the Moors.</p>
<p>
The Cathedral of Toledo is one of the most
remarkable in Spain. The arches of the transept
are semi-Moorish, Xamete, who wrought it in
Arcos stone in 1546-50, having been a Moor.
The very ancient manufactory of arms for which
Toledo has a world-wide fame dates from the time<a name="page375" id="page375"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;375]</span>
of the Goths; into this the Moors introduced
their Damascene system of ornamenting and tempering,
and as early as 852 this identical "fabrica" was at
work under Abd er-Rahman ibn El Hákim. The
Moors treasured and named their swords like
children. These were the weapons which Othello,
the Moor, "kept in his chamber."</p>

<p>
At Alcazar de San Juan, in La Mancha, I found
a few remnants of the Moorish town, as in the
church tower, but the name is now almost the only
Moorish thing about it. Hence we pass to Alarcon,
a truly Moorish city, built like a miniature Toledo,
on a craggy peninsula hemmed in by the river
Jucar. The land approach is still guarded by
Moorish towers and citadel.</p>
<p>
In Zocodovar&mdash;which takes its name from the
word sôk, "market-place"&mdash;we find a very Moorish
"plaza," with its irregular windows and balconies,
and in San Eugenio are some remains of an old
mosque with Kufic inscriptions, as well as an
arch and tomb of elaborate design. In the Calle
de las Tornarías there used to be a dilapidated
Moorish house with one still handsome room, but
it is doubtful whether this now survives the wreck
of time. It was called El Taller del Moro, because
Ambron, the Moorish governor of Huesca, is said
to have invited four hundred of the refractory chiefs
of Toledo to dine here, and to have cut off the head
of each as he arrived.  There is a curious mosque
in the Calle del Cristo de la Luz, the roof is supported
by four low square pillars, each having a
different capital, from which spring double arches
like those at Córdova. The ceiling is divided into
nine compartments with domes.</p>

<a name="page376" id="page376"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;376]</span>
<p>
Madrid has passed through such various fortunes,
and has been so much re-built, that it now contains
few traces of the Moors. The only relic
which I saw in 1890 was a large piece of tabia,
forming a substantial wall near to the new cathedral,
which might have belonged to the city wall or only
to a fortress.  The Museum of the Capital contains a
good collection of Moorish coins. In the Armoury
are Moorish guns, swords, saddles, and leather
shields, the last named made of two hides cemented
with a mortar composed of herbs and camel-hair.</p>
<p>
In Old Castile the footprints grow rare and
faint, although the name of Valladolid&mdash;Blád Walîd,
"Town of Walîd," a Moorish ameer&mdash;sufficiently
proclaims its origin, but I am not aware of any
Moorish remains there. In Burgos one old gate
near the triumphal arch, erected by Philip II., still
retains its Moorish opening, and on the opposite
hill stands the castle in which was celebrated the
bridal of our Edward I. with Eleanor of Castile.
It was then a true Moorish kasar, but part has
since been destroyed by fire. On the road from
Burgos to Vittoria we pass between the mountains
of Oca and the Pyrenean spurs, in which narrow
defile the old Spaniards defied the advancing Moors.
Moorish caverns or cisterns are still to be seen.</p>
<p>
Turning southward again, we come to Medinaceli,
or "the city of Selim," once the strong
frontier hold of a Moor of that name, the scene
of many conflicts among the Moors themselves,
and against the Christians. Here, on August 7,
1002, died the celebrated El Mansûr&mdash;"The
Victorious"&mdash;the "Cid" (Seyyid) of the Moors,
and the most terrible enemy of the Christians.<a name="page377" id="page377"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;377]</span>
He was born in 938 near Algeciras, and by a
series of intrigues, treacheries and murders, rose
in importance till he became in reality master of
the puppet ameer. He proclaimed a holy crusade
against the Christians each year, and was buried
in the dust of fifty campaigns, for after every battle
he used to shake off the soil from his garments into
a chest which he carried about with him for that
purpose.</p>
<p>
In Aragon the situation of Daroca, in the fertile
basin of the Jiloca, is very picturesque. The little
town lies in a hill-girt valley around which rise
eminences defended by Moorish walls and towers,
which, following the irregular declivities, command
charming views from above. The palace of the
Mendozas at Guadalajara, in the same district, boasts
of an elegant row of Moorish windows, though these
appear to have been constructed after Guadalajara
was reconquered from the Moors by the Spaniards.
Near this place is a Moorish brick building, turned
into a battery by the invaders, and afterwards used
as a prison. Before leaving this town it will be
worth while to visit San Miguel, once a mosque, with
its colonnaded entrance, horse-shoe arches, machiolations,
and herring-bone patterns under the roof.</p>
<p>
Calatayud, the second town of Aragon, is of
Moorish origin. Its Moorish name means the
"Castle of Ayûb"&mdash;or Job&mdash;the nephew of Mûsa,
who used the ancient Bilbilis as a quarry whence
to obtain stones for its construction. The Dominican
convent of Calatayud has a glorious patio with
three galleries rising one above another, and a
portion of the exterior is enriched with pseudo-Moorish
work like the prisons at Guadalajara.</p>

<a name="page378" id="page378"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;378]</span>
<p>
Saragossa gave me more the impression of
Moorish origin than any town I saw in Spain,
except Sevílle and Córdova. The streets of the
original settlement are just those of Mequinez on
a small scale. The only object of genuinely Moorish
origin that I could find, however, was the Aljaferia,
once a palace-citadel, now a barrack, so named
after Jáfer, a Muslim king of this province.  Since
his times Ferdinand and Isabella used it, and then
handed it over to the Inquisition.  Some of the
rooms still retain Moorish decorations, but most
of the latter are of the period of their conquerors.
On one ceiling is pointed out the first gold brought
from the New World. The only genuine Moorish
remnant is the private mosque, with beautiful inscriptions.
The building has been incorporated in
a huge fort-like modern brick structure, which
would lead no one to seek inside for Arab traces.</p>
<p>
Passing from Saragossa northwards, we arrive
at Jaca, the railway terminus, which to this day
quarters on her shield the heads of four sheïkhs
who were left behind when their fellow-countrymen
fled from the city in 795, after a desperate
battle in which the Spanish women fought like
men.  The site of the battle, called Las Tiendas,
is still visited on the first Friday in May, when
the daughters of these Amazons go gloriously
"a-shopping." The municipal charter of Jaca dates
from the Moorish expulsion, and is reckoned among
the earliest in Spain.</p>
<p>
Gerona, almost within sight of France, played
an important part, too, in those days, siding alternately
with that country and with Spain when in the
possession of the Moors. The Ameer Sulaïmán,<a name="page379" id="page379"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;379]</span>
in 759 <span class="sc">a.d.</span>, entered into an alliance with Pepin, and
in 785 Charlemagne took the town, which the
Moors re-captured ten years later. It became their
headquarters for raids upon Narbonne and Nîsmes.
Castellon de Ampurias, once on the coast, which
has receded, was strong enough to resist
the Moors for a time, but after they had dismantled
it, the Normans appeared and finally destroyed it.
Now it is but a hamlet.</p>
<p>
We are now in the extreme north-west of the
Peninsula, where the relics we seek grow scanty,
and, in consequence, of more importance. Instead
of buildings in stone or concrete, we find here a
monument of independence, perhaps more interesting
in its way than any other. When the Pyrenees
and their hardy mountaineers checked the onward
rush of Islám, several independent states arose,
recognized by both France and Spain on account
of their bravery in opposing a common foe. The
only one of these retaining a semi-independence is
the republic of Andorra, a name corrupted from the
Arabic el (al) darra, "a plenteous rainfall," showing
how the Moors appreciated this feature of so well
wooded and hilly a district after the arid plains of
the south. The old Moorish castle of the chief
town bears the name of Carol, derived from that
of Charlemagne, who granted it the privileges
it still enjoys, so that it is a memento of the
meeting of Arab and Teuton. At Planes is a
church said to be of Moorish origin, and earlier
than Charlemagne; it certainly dates from no later
than the tenth century. These "foot-prints" show
that the Moor got a fairly good footing here, before
he was driven back, and his progress stayed.</p>

<h3>"MOROCCO NEWS"</h3>
<p class="center1">
"A lie is not worth the lying, nor is truth worth repeating."</p>
<p class="rindent">
<i>Moorish Proverb.</i></p>

<p>
So unanimous have been the uninformed reiteration
of the Press in contravention of much that has
been stated in the foregoing pages, that it will not
be out of place to quote a few extracts from men on
the spot who do know the facts. The first three
are from leaders in <i>Al-moghreb Al-aksa</i>, the present
English paper in Morocco, which accurately voices
the opinion of the British Colony in that country,
opinions shared by most disinterested residents of
other nationalities.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"However we look upon the situation as it
stands to-day, and wherever our sympathies may
lie, it is impossible to over-estimate the danger
attending the unfortunate Anglo-French Agreement.
We have always&mdash;as our readers will acknowledge&mdash;advocated
the simple doctrine of the <i>status quo</i>,
and in this have received the support of every disinterested
person in and out of Morocco.  Our
policy has at times thrown us into antagonism with
the exponents of the French colonial schemes; but
we at least have the satisfaction of knowing that,
however we may have fallen short of our duty, it<a name="page382" id="page382"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;382]</span>
has been one which we have persevered in, prompted
by earnest conviction, by love of the country and
its people, and by admiration for its Sultan. The
simplicity of our aim has helped us in our uphill
fight, and will, no doubt, continue to do so in the
future.</p>
<p>
"Needless to say we look forward with no little
anxiety to the result of the conference. This needs
no explanation. In the discussion of such a question
it is absolutely imperative that the individual
members of the conference should be selected from
those who know their Morocco, and who are
acquainted with the causes which led up to the
present dead-lock. Only the keenest, shrewdest
men should be selected, for it must be borne in
mind that France will spare no pains to uphold
the recent Anglo-French Convention. Her most astute
diplomats will figure largely, for her dignity is at
stake. Indeed, her very position, diplomatic and
political, is in effect challenged. Taking this into
consideration, it is more than necessary to see that
the representatives of Great Britain are not chosen
for their family influence or for the perfection they
may have attained in the French language.</p>
<p>
"The task is hard and perilous. England is
waking to the fact that she has blundered, and,
as usual, she is unwilling to admit the fact. Circumstances,
however, will sooner or later force
her to modify her terms. Germany, Spain, the
United States, and other nations, to say nothing
of Morocco, must point out the absurdity of the
situation. If the agreement is inoperative with
regard to Morocco, it may as well be openly admitted
to be useless. This is not all. Should
English statesmanship direct that this injudicious
arrangement be adhered to, France and Great
Britain will stand as self-confessed violators of the
Convention of Madrid.</p>

<a name="page383" id="page383"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;383]</span>
<p>
"Fortunately the Moorish cause has some excellent
champions. For many years she has been
dumb. Now, however, that she is assailed, we find
a small but influential band of writers coming forward
with their pens to do battle for her.</p>
<p>
"This is the great consolation we have. Moorish
interests will no longer be the sport of European
political expediency. These men will, no doubt, protest
against the land-grabbing propensities of the
French colonial party, and they may find time to
point out that after a thousand years of not ignoble
independence, the Moorish race deserves a little
more consideration than has hitherto been granted.</p>
<p>
"Even those people who are responsible for this
deplorable state of affairs must now stand more or
less amazed at their handiwork. No diplomatic
subterfuge can efface the humiliation that underlies
the situation; and no one can possibly exaggerate
the danger that lies ahead of us."</p>

<br /><hr class="short" /><br />
<p>
"Two centuries ago Great Britain abandoned
Tangier, and it is only the present generation that
has realized the huge mistake. A maudlin sentimentalism,
to avoid displeasing the French King,
prevented us from handing the city back to Portugal;
an act which would have been wise, either
strategically, commercially, or with a view to the
suppression of the famous Salee rovers, who were
for long a scourge to ships entering the Straits. A
Commission of experts was appointed to consider
the question of the abandonment, one of them being
Mr. Pepys....</p>
<p>
"Whatever the opinion may have been of the
experts consulted by the Government on the present
agreement with France, we are strongly disposed
to believe that if they have been endowed with
greater sense than those of 1683, there is probably
more, as we must hope there is, in favour of British<a name="page384" id="page384"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;384]</span>
interests, than appears to the public eye. Time
alone will tell what reservation, mental or otherwise,
may be locked up in the British Foreign Office.
It is difficult to believe that any British statesman
would wantonly give away any national interest,
but too lofty a policy has often been wanting in
practical sense which, had that policy descended
from principles to facts, would have saved the
nation thousands of lives, millions of money, and
sacrifices of its best interests."</p>

<br /><hr class="short" /><br />
<p>
"The events that have been fully before the
eyes of British subjects in Morocco in the abnormal
condition of the country during the past two years,
seem to have been ignored by our Foreign Office.
In short, it fully appears that our Foreign Office
policy has been designed to lead the Sultan to
political destruction, and to sacrifice every British
interest.</p>
<p>
"About two years ago our Foreign Office began
well in starting the Sultan on the path of progress:
in carrying out its aims it has done nothing but
blunders. Had it but acted with a little firmness,
the opening up of this country would have already
begun, and there would have been no 'Declaration'
which will assuredly give future Foreign Secretaries
matter for some anxiety. The declaration is only a
display of political fireworks that will dazzle the
eyes of the British public for a while, delighting
our Little Englanders, but only making the future
hazy and possibly more dangerous to deal with. It
seems only a way of putting off the real settlement,
which may not wait for thirty years to be dealt
with, on the points still at issue, and for which a
splendid opportunity has been thrown away at
Downing Street, and could have been availed of to
maintain British interests, prestige, and influence in
this country. Briefly, we fear that the attainment<a name="page385" id="page385"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;385]</span>
of the end in view may yet cost millions to the
British nation.</p>
<p>
"That Morocco will progress under French
guidance there can be no question, and France may
be congratulated on her superior diplomacy
and the working of her Foreign Office system."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
With regard to the Moorish position, a contributor
observes in a later issue&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The attitude of the Sultan and his Cabinet
may be summed up in a few words. 'You nations
have made your agreements about our country without
consulting us. We owe you nothing that we
are unable to pay on the conditions arranged
between us. We did not ask your subjects to
reside and trade on Moorish soil. In fact, we have
invariably discouraged their so doing. Troubles
exist in Morocco, it is true, but we are far greater
sufferers than you&mdash;our unbidden guests. And
but for the wholesale smuggling of repeating rifles
by <i>your</i> people, our tribes would not be able to
cause the disorders of which you complain. As
to your intention to intervene in our affairs, we
agree to no interference. If you are resolved to
try force, we believe that the Faith of the Prophet
will conquer. We still believe there is a God
stronger than man. And should the fight go
against us, we believe that it is better to earn Paradise
in a holy war for the defence of our soil, than
to submit tamely to Christian rule.'</p>
<p>
"The position, however lamentable, is intelligible;
but on the other hand it is incredible that
France&mdash;her mind made up long ago that she is to
inherit the Promised Land of Sunset&mdash;will sit down
meekly and allow herself to be flouted by the
monarch and people of a crumbling power like
Morocco. And this is what she has to face. Not<a name="page386" id="page386"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;386]</span>
indeed a nation, as we understand the term, but a
gathering of units differing widely in character and
race&mdash;Arabs, Berbers, mulattoes, and negroes&mdash;unable
to agree together on any subject under the
sun but one, and that one the defence of Islám
from foreign intervention. Under the standard of
the invincible Prophet they will join shoulder to
shoulder. And hopeless and pathetic as it may
seem, they will defy the disciplined ranks and
magazine guns of Europe. Thus, wherever our
sympathies may lie, the possibilities of a peaceful
settlement of the Morocco question appear to be
dwindling day by day. The anarchy paramount in
three-quarters of the sultanate is not only an ever-increasing
peril to European lives and property,
but a direct encouragement to intervention. Of
one thing we in Morocco have no kind of doubt.
The landing of foreign troops, even for protective
service, in any one part of the coast would infallibly
be the signal for a general rising in every part
of the Empire. No sea-port would be safe for
foreigners or for friendly natives until protected by
a strong European force. And, once begun, the
task of 'pacifying' the interior must entail an
expenditure of lives and treasure which will amply
satisfy French demands for colonial extension for
many a year to come."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
One more quotation from an editorial&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"And so it would appear, that, with the smiling
approval of the world's Press, the wolf is to take
over the affairs of the lamb. We use the phrase
advisedly. We have never hesitated to criticize the
action, and to condemn the errors, of the Makhzen
where such a course has been needful in the public
interest. We can, therefore, with all the more
justice, call attention to the real issues of the compact<a name="page387" id="page387"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;387]</span>
embodied in the Morocco clauses of the Anglo-French
Agreement of April, 1904. How long the
leading journals of England may continue to ignore
the facts of the case it is impossible to say; but
that there will come a startling awakening seems
inevitable. Every merely casual observer on this
side of the Mediterranean knows only too well
that the most trifling pretext may be at any hour
seized for the next move in the development of
French intervention. Evidence is piling up to show
that the forward party in France, and still more in
Algeria, is burning to strike while yet the frantic
enthusiasm of the Entente lasts, and while they can
rely upon the support&mdash;we had almost written, the
moral support&mdash;of Great Britain. Can we shut our
eyes to the deliberate provocations they are giving
the Makhzen in almost every part of the sultanate?</p>
<p>
"These things are not reported to Europe,
naturally. In spite of all our comfortable cant about
justice to less powerful races, who in England cares
about justice to Morocco and her Sultan? We owe
it to Germany that the thing was not rushed
through a few months ago. Who has heard, who
wants to hear, the Moorish side of the question?
Morocco is mute. The Sultan pulls no journalistic
wires. He has no advocate in the Press, or in
Parliament, or in Society. Hardly a public man
opens his mouth in England to refer to Morocco,
without talking absolute twaddle. The only member
of either House of Parliament who has shown a real
grasp of the tremendous issues of the question is
Lord Rosebery, in the memorable words&mdash;</p>
<p>
"'No more one-sided agreement was ever concluded
between two Powers at peace with each
other. I hope and trust, but I hope and trust
rather than believe, that the Power which holds
Gibraltar may never have cause to regret having
handed Morocco over to a great military Power.'</p>

<a name="page388" id="page388"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;388]</span>
<p>
"Had that true statesman, and true Englishman,
been in power eighteen months ago, England would
never have been pledged to sacrifice her commercial
interests in Morocco, to abandon her wholesome,
traditional policy in the Mediterranean, and to
revoke her solemn engagement to uphold the integrity
of the Sultan's dominions."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
An excellent idea of the discrepancies between
the alarmist reports with which the Press is from
time to time deluged, and the facts as known on
the spot, is afforded by the following extracts from
<i>Al-moghreb Al-aksa</i> of January 7, 1905, when the
London papers had been almost daily victimized by
their correspondents regarding Morocco:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The dismissal of the military <i>attachés</i> at the
Moorish Court threatened to raise a terrible conflagration
in Europe, and great indignation among
foreign residents in this country&mdash;according to
certain Press reports. This fiery disposition of
some offered a remarkable contrast with the coolness
of the others. For instance, the British took
almost no interest in the matter, for the simple
reason that there has never been any British official
military mission in the Moorish Court. It is true
there are a few British subjects in Moorish military
service, but they are privately employed by the
Sultan's Government, and their service is simply
voluntary. Even personally, they actually show no
great concern in remaining here or not.</p>
<p>
"The Italian military mission is composed of
very few persons. The chief, Col. Ferrara, is on
leave in Italy, and the Mission is now represented
by Captain Campini, who lives at Fez with his
family. They report having received all kind attentions
from the Sultan quite recently, and that they<a name="page389" id="page389"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;389]</span>
know nothing about the dismissal which has so
noisily sounded in Europe. According to the same
Press reports, great fears were entertained of a
general rising against the foreign residents in Fez
and other places in the interior, and while it is
reported that the military <i>attachés</i>, consular officers
and residents of all nations were notified to leave
Fez and come to Tangier or the coast ports as a
matter of precaution, we find that nobody moves
from the Court, because, they say, they have seen
nothing to induce them to leave that residence.
And what has Mulai Abd El Azîz replied to French
complaints and demands respecting the now historical
dismissal of the military <i>attachés</i>? A very simple
thing&mdash;that H.S.M. did not think that the dismissal
could resent any of the civilized nations,
because it was decided as an economic measure,
there being no money to pay even other more
pressing liabilities. However, the Sultan, wishing
to be on friendly terms with France and all other
nations, immediately withdrew the dismissal and
promised to pay the <i>attachés</i> as long as it is possible
to do so. The missions, consuls, etc., have now no
need to leave Fez, and everything remains stationary
as before. The only thing steadily progressing is
the insecurity of life and property in the outskirts
and district of Tangier, where murders and robberies
proceed unabated, and this state of affairs has caused
the British and German residents in this town to
send petitions to their respective Governments,
through their legations, soliciting that some measure
may be adopted to do away with the present state
of insecurity which has already paralysed all overland
traffic between this city and the neighbouring towns.</p>
<p>
"The contrasts of the situation are as remarkable
as they are comic, and while the whole country is
perfectly quiet, those places more in contact with<a name="page390" id="page390"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;390]</span>
the civilized world, like Tangier and the Algerian
frontier, are the only spots which are seriously
troubled with disturbances."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
So much for northern Morocco. The same
issue contains the following report from its Mogador
correspondent regarding the "disturbed state" of
southern Morocco.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"It would puzzle even the trained imagination
of certain journalists we wot of to evolve anything
alarmist out of the condition of the great tribes
between Mogador and the Atlas. During the
recent tribal differences not one single highway
robbery, even of a native, was, I believe, committed.
The roads are open everywhere; the rival chieftains
have, figuratively, exchanged the kiss of peace, and
the tribes have confessed that it was a mistake to
leave their farms and farm-work simply to please an
ambitious and utterly thankless governor.</p>
<p>
"As for Europeans, they have been rambling
all over the country with their wonted freedom
from interference. A Frenchman, travelling almost
alone, has just returned from Imintanoot. Another
has twice crossed the Atlas. Needless to say the
route to Marrákesh is almost as devoid of other
than pleasurable novelty as a stroll on the Embankment
or down the shady side of Pall Mall. When,
indeed, will folks at home grasp the fact that the
Berber clans of southern Morocco belong to a race
differing utterly in character and largely in customs
from the ruffians infesting the northern half of the
sultanate?</p>
<p>
"'Nothing but the unpleasant prospect of being
held up by brigands,' writes a friend, 'prevents me
from revisiting your beautiful country.' How convince
such people that brigandage is an art unknown
south of the Oom Rabya? That the prayer of the<a name="page391" id="page391"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;391]</span>
Shluh, when a Nazarene visits their land, is that
nothing may happen to bring trouble on the clan?
They may inwardly hate the <i>Rûmi</i>, or they may
regard him merely as an uncouth blot on the
scenery; but should actual unpleasantness arise,
he will, in almost every case, have himself to thank
for it. (London papers please copy!)"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This letter was dated two days after the Paris
correspondent of the <i>Times</i> had telegraphed&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Events would seem likely to be coming to a
head in consequence of the anarchy prevailing in
the Shereefian Empire. The Pretender is just now
concentrating his troops in the plain of Angad, and
is preparing to take an energetic offensive against
Ujda. The camp of the Pretender is imposing in
its warlike display. All the caids and the sons of
Bu Amema surround Mulai Mahomed. The men
are armed with French <i>chassepots</i>, and are well
dressed in new uniforms supplied by an Oran firm.
All the war material was embarked on board the
French yacht <i>Zut</i>, which landed it last month on
the shores of Rastenga between Cape Eau and
Melilla under the direction of the Pretender's
troops."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Towards Christmas, 1902, circumstantial reports
began to appear in the newspapers of an overwhelming
defeat of the imperial army by rebels who were
marching on Fez, who had besieged it, and had cut
off the aqueduct bringing its water, the Sultan retreating
to the palace, Europeans being ordered to
the coast, etc., etc. These statements I promptly
and categorically denied in an interview for the
London <i>Echo</i>; there was no real "pretender," only
a religious fanatic supported by two disaffected<a name="page392" id="page392"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;392]</span>
tribes, the imperial army had not been defeated, as
only a small body had been despatched to quell the
disturbance; the "rebels" were not besieging Fez, as
they had no army, and only the guns captured by
the clever midnight surprise of sleeping troops, of
which the "battle"&mdash;really a panic&mdash;consisted; they
had not cut the "aqueduct," as Fez is built on the
banks of a river from which it drinks; the Sultan's
palace was his normal abode; the Europeans had
not fled, seeing no danger, but that <i>on account of the
alarming telegrams from Europe</i>, their Ministers in
Tangier had advised them to withdraw, much
against their will.</p>
<p>
So sweeping a contradiction of statements receiving
daily confirmation from Tangier, heightened
colour from Oran, and intensification from Madrid,
must have been regarded as the ravings of a madman,
for the interview was held over for a week for
confirmation. Had not thirty-four correspondents
descended on Tangier alone, each with expenses to
meet? Something had to be said, though the
correspondent nearest to the scene, in Fez, was two
days' journey from it, and six from Tangier, the
nearest telegraph station. It is true that some
years ago an American boldly did the journey
"From Fez to Fleet Street in Eight Days," by forgetting
most of the journey to Tangier, but this was
quite out-done now. Meanwhile every rumour was
remodelled in Oran or Madrid, and served up afresh
with confirmatory <i>sauce piquante</i>, <i>à la française</i> or
<i>à l'espagnol</i>, as the case might be. It was not till
Reuter had obtained an independent, common-sense
report, that the interview was published, my statements
having been all confirmed, but by that time<a name="page393" id="page393"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;393]</span>
interest had flagged, and the British public still
believes that a tremendous upheaval took place in
Morocco just then.</p>
<p>
Yet, notwithstanding the detailed accounts of
battles and reverses&mdash;a collation of which shows
the "Father of the She-ass" fighting in several
places at once, captured or slain to-day and fighting
to-morrow, and so on&mdash;the Government of Morocco
was never in real danger from the "Rogi's" rising,
and the ultimate issue was never in doubt. The
late Sultan, El Hasan, more than once suffered in
person at the hands of the same tribes, defeats more
serious than those experienced by the inadequate
forces sent by his son.</p>
<p>
The moral of all this is that any news from
Morocco, save that concerning Europeans or events
on the coast, must be received with caution, and
confirmation awaited. The most reliable accounts
at present available are those of the <i>Times</i> correspondent
at Tangier, while the <i>Manchester Guardian</i>
is well informed from Mogador. Whatever emanates
from Paris or Algeria, not referring directly to frontier
events; or from Madrid, not referring to events
near the Spanish "presidios," should be refused
altogether, as at best it is second-hand, more often
fabricated. How the London Press can seriously
publish telegrams about Morocco from New York
and Washington passes comprehension. The low
ebb reached by American journals with one or two
notable exceptions in their competitive sensationalism
would of itself suffice to discredit much
that appears, even were the countries in touch with
each other.</p>
<p>
The fact is that very few men in Morocco itself<a name="page394" id="page394"></a><span class="left">[page&nbsp;394]</span>
are in a position to form adequate judgements on
current affairs, or even to collect reliable news from
all parts. So few have direct relations with the
authorities, native and foreign; so many can only
rely on and amplify rumour or information from
interested sources. So many, too, of the latter <i>must</i>
make money somehow! The soundest judgements
are to be formed by those who, being well-informed
as to the conditions and persons concerned, and

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
